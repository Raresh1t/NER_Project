The new cybercrime operation is named after the mysterious 2012 - 2014 online / real - world game that involved elaborate cryptographic puzzles and used the same logo for promotion on cybercrime forums. However, there's no connection between the two, and the legitimate project has issued a statement to renounce any association and condemn the ransomware operators'actions. The Cicada3301 RaaS first began promoting the operation and recruiting affiliates on June 29, 2024, in a forum post to the ransomware and cybercrime forum known as RAMP. However, BleepingComputer is aware of Cicada attacks as early as June 6, indicating that the gang was operating independently before attempting to recruit affiliates. Like other ransomware operations, Cicada3301 conducts double - extortion tactics where they breach corporate networks, steal data, and then encrypt devices. The encryption key and threats to leak stolen data are then used as leverage to scare victims into paying a ransom. The threat actors operate a data leak site that is used as part of their double - extortion scheme. An analysis of the new malware by Truesec revealed significant overlaps between Cicada3301 and ALPHV / BlackCat, indicating a possible rebrand or a fork created by former ALPHV's core team members. This is based on the fact that : For context, ALPHV performed an exit scam in early March 2024 involving fake claims about an FBI takedown operation after they stole a massive $ 22 million payment from Change Healthcare from one of their affiliates. Truesec has also found indications that the Cicada3301 ransomware operation may partner with or utilize the Brutus botnet for initial access to corporate networks. That botnet was previously associated with global - scale VPN brute - forcing activities targeting Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, and SonicWall appliances. It's worth noting that the Brutus activity was first spotted two weeks after ALPHV shut down operations, so the link between the two groups still stands in terms of timelines. Cicada3301 is a Rust - based ransom",

According to court documents, company employees received a ransom email titled \" Your Network Has Been Penetrated \" on November 25, around 4 : 44 PM EST. The email claimed that all IT administrators had been locked out of their accounts and server backups had been deleted to make data recovery impossible. Additionally, the message threatened to shut down 40 random servers on the company's network daily over the next ten days unless a ransom of \u20ac700, 000 ( in the form of 20 Bitcoin ) was paid \u2014 at the time, 20 BTC were worth $ 750, 000. The investigation coordinated by FBI Special Agent James E. Dennehy in Newark uncovered that 57 - year - old Daniel Rhyne from Kansas City, Missouri, who was working as a core infrastructure engineer for the New Jersey industrial company, had remotely accessed the company's computer systems without authorization using a company administrator account between November 9 and November 25. He then scheduled tasks on the company's domain controlled to change the passwords for the Administrator account, 13 domain administrator accounts, and 301 domain user accounts to the \" TheFr0zenCrew! \" text string. The criminal complaint alleges that Rhyne also scheduled tasks to change the passwords for two local administrator accounts, which would impact 254 servers, and for two more local admin accounts, which would affect 3, 284 workstations on his employer's network. He also scheduled some tasks to shut down random servers and workstations over multiple days in December 2023. The investigators also found during forensic analysis that, while planning his extortion plot, Rhyne allegedly used a hidden virtual machine he accessed using his account and laptop to search the web on November 22 for information on how to delete domain accounts, clear Windows logs, and change domain user passwords using the command line. On November 15, Rhyne also made similar web searches on his laptop, including \" command line to change local administrator password \" and \" command line to remotely change local administrator password. \" \" By changing administrator and user passwords and shutting down Victim - l's servers, the scheduled tasks were collectively designed and intended to deny Victim - 1 access to its systems and data, \" the criminal complaint reads. \" On or about November 25, 2023,",

Palo Alto GlobalProtect is a legitimate security solution offered by Palo Alto Networks that provides secure VPN access with multi - factor authentication support. Organizations widely use the product to ensure remote employees, contractors, and partners can securely access private network resources. Using Palo Alto GlobalProtect as bait shows the attackers'targeting focuses on high - value corporate entities using enterprise software rather than random users. Researchers at Trend Micro who discovered this campaign have no insight into how the malware is delivered, but based on the lure used, they believe the attack starts with a phishing email. The victim executes a file named'setup. exe'on their system, which deploys a file called'GlobalProtect. exe'along with configuration files. At this stage, a window resembling a normal GlobalProtect installation process appears, but the malware quietly loads on the system in the background. Upon execution, it checks for signs of running on a sandbox before executing its primary code. Then, it transmits profiling information about the breached machine onto the command and control ( C2 ) server. As an additional evasion layer, the malware uses AES encryption on its strings and data packets to be exfiltrated to the C2. The C2 address seen by Trend Micro used a newly registered URL containing the \" sharjahconnect \" string, making it appear like a legitimate VPN connection portal for Sharjah - based offices in the United Arab Emirates. Considering the campaign's targeting scope, this choice helps the threat actors blend with normal operations and reduce red flags that could raise the victim's suspicion. Beacons sent out at periodic intervals are employed to communicate the malware status with the threat actors in the post - infection phase using the Interactsh open - source tool. While Interactsh is a legitimate open - source tool commonly used by pentesters, its related domain, oast. fun, has also been observed in APT - level operations in the past, like in APT28 campaigns.

The ransomware group focuses on data - theft - based extortion rather than encrypting victims'files, although they were also identified as potential buyers of Knight ransomware source code. Since the start of the year, RansomHub has claimed responsibility for breaching American not - for - profit credit union Patelco, the Rite Aid drugstore chain, the Christie's auction house, U.

RansomHub's data leak site also leaked stolen Change Healthcare data after the BlackCat / ALPHV ransomware operation shut down. A joint advisory released today by the FBI, CISA, the Multi - State Information Sharing and Analysis Center ( MS - ISAC ), and the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) also confirms that the threat actors target their victims in double - extortion attacks.

Specifically, the easy - to - exploit flaw lies in the \" brightness \" argument in the \" action = \" parameter of the AVTECH cameras'firmware, intended to allow remote adjustments to the brightness of a camera. The flaw impacts all AVTECH AVM1203 IP cameras running on firmware versions up to Fullmg - 1023 - 1007 - 1011 - 1009. Due to the impacted models no longer being supported by the Taiwanese vendor, having reached their end of life ( EoL ) in 2019, no patch is available to address CVE - 2024 - 7029, and no fixes are expected to be released. The U. S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an advisory at the start of the month to warn about CVE - 2024 - 7029 and the availability of public exploits, warning that the cameras are still used in commercial facilities, financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation systems.

Throughout these attacks, the threat actors leveraged Microsoft Azure infrastructure for command - and - control ( C2 ), using fraudulent, attacker - controlled Azure subscriptions that the company has since disrupted. APT33 breached targeted organizations in the defense, space, education, and government sectors following successful password spray attacks between April and May 2024. In these attacks, they attempted to gain access to many accounts using a small number of commonly used passwords to avoid triggering account lockouts. \" While the password spray activity appeared consistently across sectors, Microsoft observed Peach Sandstorm exclusively leveraging compromised user accounts in the education sector to procure operational infrastructure. In these cases, the threat actor accessed existing Azure subscriptions or created one using the compromised account to host their infrastructure, \" Microsoft said. The Azure infrastructure they gained control of was used in subsequent operations targeting the government, defense, and space sectors. \" In the past year, Peach Sandstorm has successfully compromised several organizations, primarily in the aforementioned sectors, using bespoke tooling, \" Microsoft added. The Iranian threat group also used this tactic in November 2023 to compromise the networks of defense contractors worldwide and deploy FalseFont backdoor malware.

            "text": "A new malware campaign is spreading a previously undocumented backdoor named \" Voldemort \" to organizations worldwide, impersonating tax agencies from the U. S., Europe, and Asia. As per a Proofpoint report, the campaign started on August 5, 2024, and has disseminated over 20, 000 emails to over 70 targeted organizations, reaching 6, 000 in a single day at the peak of its activity. Over half of all targeted organizations are in the insurance, aerospace, transportation, and education sectors. The threat actor behind this campaign is unknown, but Proofpoint believes the most likely objective is to conduct cyber espionage. The attack is similar to what Proofpoint described at the start of the month but involved a different malware set in the final stage. A new Proofpoint report says the attackers are crafting phishing emails to match a targeted organization's location based on public information. The phishing emails impersonate taxing authorities from the organization's country, stating that there is updated tax information and includes links to associated documents. Clicking on the link brings recipients to a landing page hosted on InfinityFree, which uses Google AMP Cache URLs to redirect the victim to a page with a \" Click to view document \" button. When the button is clicked, the page will check the browser's User Agent, and if it's for Windows, redirect the target to a search - ms URI ( Windows Search Protocol ) that points to a TryCloudflare - tunneled URI. Non - Windows users are redirected to an empty Google Drive URL that serves no malicious content. If the victim interacts with the search - ms file, Windows Explorer is triggered to display a LNK or ZIP file disguised as a PDF. The use of the search - ms : URI has become popular lately with phishing campaigns as even though this file is hosted on an external WebDAV / SMB share, it is made to appear as if it resides locally in the Downloads folder to trick the victim into opening it. Doing so executes a Python script from another WebDAV share without downloading it on the host, which performs system info collection to profile the victim. At the same time, a decoy PDF is displayed to obscure the malicious activity. The script also downloads a legitimate",

Citrine Sleet targets financial institutions, focusing on cryptocurrency organizations and associated individuals, and has been previously linked to Bureau 121 of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. The North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites camouflaged as legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect potential victims with fake job applications or weaponized cryptocurrency wallets or trading apps. UNC4736 trojanized the Electron - based desktop client of video conferencing software maker 3CX in March 2023, following a previous supply - chain attack in which they breached the site of Trading Technologies, a stock trading automation company, to push trojanized X _ TRADER software builds.

            "text": "The malicious PoorTry kernel - mode Windows driver used by multiple ransomware gangs to turn off Endpoint Detection and Response ( EDR ) solutions has evolved into an EDR wiper, deleting files crucial for the operation of security solutions and making restoration harder. Though Trend Micro had warned about this functionality added on Poortry since May 2023, Sophos has now confirmed seeing the EDR wiping attacks in the wild. This evolution of PoorTry from an EDR deactivator to an EDR wiper represents a very aggressive shift in tactics by ransomware actors, who now prioritize a more disruptive setup phase to ensure better outcomes in the encryption stage. PoorTry, also known as'BurntCigar,'was developed in 2021 as a kernel - mode driver to disable EDR and other security software. The kit, used by several ransomware gangs, including BlackCat, Cuba, and LockBit, first gained attention when its developers found ways to get their malicious drivers signed through Microsoft's attestation signing process. Other cybercrime groups, such as Scattered Spider, were also seen utilizing the tool in breaches focused on credential theft and SIM - swapping attacks. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Poortry continued to evolve, optimizing its code and using obfuscation tools like VMProtect, Themida, and ASMGuard to pack the driver and its loader ( Stonestop ) for evasion. The latest report by Sophos is based on a RansomHub attack in July 2024 that employed Poortry to delete critical executable files ( EXEs ), dynamic link libraries ( DLLs ), and other essential components of security software. This ensures that EDR software cannot be recovered or restarted by defenders, leaving the system completely unprotected in the following encryption phase of the attack. The process starts with the user - mode component of PoorTry, identifying the security software's installation directories and the critical files within those directories. It then sends requests to the kernel - mode component to systematically terminate security - related processes and then delete their crucial files. Paths to those files are hardcoded onto PoorTry, while the user - mode component supports deletion either by file name or type, giving it some operational flexibility to cover a broader range of",

Columbus, the capital and most populous ( 2, 140, 000 ) city in Ohio, suffered a ransomware attack on July 18, 2024, which caused various service outages and unavailability of email and IT connectivity between public agencies. At the end of July, the City's administration announced that no systems had been encrypted, but they were looking into the possibility that sensitive data might have been stolen in the attack. On the same day, Rhysida ransomware claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging they stole 6. 5 TB of databases, including employee credentials, server dumps, city video camera feeds, and other sensitive information. On August 8, after failing to extort the City, the threat actors published 45 % of stolen data comprising 260, 000 files ( 3. 1 TB ), exposing much of what they previously claimed to be holding. According to the City's complaint, the exposed dataset includes two backup databases containing large amounts of data gathered by the local prosecutors and police force, dating back to at least 2015, containing, among other things, the personal information of undercover officers. On the day of the data leak on Rhysida's extortion portal on the dark web, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther stated on local media that the disclosed information was neither valuable nor usable and that the attack had been successfully thwarted. A few hours later, Goodwolf disputed the Mayor's claim that no sensitive or valuable data was exposed by sharing information with the media about what the leaked dataset included. In response to this, on August 12, Mayor Ginther claimed that the exposed data was \" encrypted or corrupted, \" so the leak is unusable and should be of no concern to the public. However, Goodwolf disputed these claims, sharing samples of the data with the media to illustrate that it contained unencrypted personal data of people in Columbus. \" Among the details laid bare were names from domestic violence cases, and Social Security numbers for police officers and crime victims alike. The dump not only impacts city employees, but also revealed personal information for residents and visitors going back years, \" reported NBC4.

            "text": "Security researchers have found a vulnerability in a key air transport security system that allowed unauthorized individuals to potentially bypass airport security screenings and gain access to aircraft cockpits. Researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered the vulnerability in FlyCASS, a third - party web - based service that some airlines use to manage the Known Crewmember ( KCM ) program and the Cockpit Access Security System ( CASS ). KCM is a Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) initiative that allows pilots and flight attendants to skip security screening, and CASS enables authorized pilots to use jumpseats in cockpits when traveling. The KCM system, operated by ARINC ( a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace ), verifies airline employees'credentials through an online platform. The process involves scanning a KCM barcode or entering an employee number, then cross - checking with the airline's database to grant access without requiring a security screening. Similarly, the CASS system verifies pilots for cockpit jumpseat access when they need to commute or travel. The researchers discovered that FlyCASS's login system was susceptible to SQL injection, a vulnerability that enables attackers to insert SQL statements for malicious database queries. By exploiting this flaw, they could log in as an administrator for a participating airline, Air Transport International, and manipulate employee data within the system. They added a fictitious employee, \" Test TestOnly, \" and granted this account access to KCM and CASS, which effectively allowed them to \" skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners. \" \" Anyone with basic knowledge of SQL injection could login to this site and add anyone they wanted to KCM and CASS, allowing themselves to both skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners, \" Carroll said. Realizing the severity of the issue, the researchers immediately began a disclosure process, contacting the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) on April 23, 2024. The researchers decided not to contact the FlyCASS site directly as it appeared to be run by a single person and were afraid the disclosure would alarm them. The DHS responded, acknowledging the seriousness of the vulnerability, and confirmed that FlyCASS was disconnected from the KCM / CASS system on May 7, 2024, as a precautionary measure. Soon after, the vulnerability was fixed on FyCASS. However, efforts to further coordinate a safe disclosure",

The activity was discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group ( TAG ), who said the n - day flaws have already been patched but remain effective on devices that have not been updated. APT29, also known as \" Midnight Blizzard \", targeted multiple websites of the Mongolian government and employed \" watering hole \" tactics. A watering hole is a cyberattack where a legitimate site is compromised with malicious code designed to deliver payloads to visitors that meet specific criteria, like device architecture or location ( IP - based ).

Google's threat analysts note that APT29 has a long history of exploiting zero - day and n - day vulnerabilities. In 2021, the Russian cyber - operatives exploited CVE - 2021 - 1879 as a zero - day, targeting government officials in Eastern Europe, attempting to deliver a cookie - stealing framework that snatched LinkedIn, Gmail, and Facebook accounts.

            "text": "The South Korea - aligned cyberespionage group APT - C - 60 has been leveraging a zero - day code execution vulnerability in the Windows version of WPS Office to install the SpyGlace backdoor on East Asian targets. WPS Office is a productivity suite developed by the Chinese firm Kingsoft that is popular in Asia. Reportedly, it has over 500 million active users worldwide. The zero - day flaw, tracked as CVE - 2024 - 7262, has been leveraged in attacks in the wild since at least late February 2024, but impacts versions from 12. 2. 0. 13110 ( August 2023 ) to 12. 1. 0. 16412 ( March 2024 ). Kingsoft \" silently \" patched the problem in March this year without informing the customers that the flaw was actively exploited, prompting ESET, who discovered the campaign and vulnerability, to publish a detailed report today. In addition to CVE - 2024 - 7262, ESET's investigation unveiled a second severe flaw, tracked as CVE - 2024 - 7263, which Kingsoft patched in late May 2024 with version 12. 2. 0. 17119. CVE - 2024 - 7262 resides in how the software handles custom protocol handlers, specifically'ksoqing : / /,'which allows the execution of external applications through specially crafted URLs within documents. Due to improper validation and sanitization of these URLs, the flaw allows attackers to craft malicious hyperlinks that lead to arbitrary code execution. APT - C - 60 created spreadsheet documents ( MHTML files ) where they embedded malicious hyperlinks hidden under a decoy image to trick the victim into clicking them, triggering the exploit. The processed URL parameters include a base64 - encoded command to execute a specific plugin ( promecefpluginhost. exe ) that attempts to load a malicious DLL ( ksojscore. dll ) containing the attacker's code. This DLL is APT - C - 60's downloader component, designed for fetching the final payload ( TaskControler. dll ) from the attacker's server, a custom backdoor named'SpyGlace.'SpyGlace is a backdoor previously analyzed by Threatbook",

The apps have been removed from the official Android and iOS stores after accumulating several thousand downloads, say researcher at cybersecurity company Group - IB, who discovered the fraud. Pig butchering is the name of a scam where the victim is led to believe they are getting high investment returns on a fake trading platform that displays fabricated information. Fraudsters use social engineering to keep the victim depositing funds and prevent them from withdrawing the displayed \" profit. \" The scam is revealed when the victim attempts to cash their money, which the fraudsters have already moved to their accounts. The fraudulent apps, which Group - IB categorizes under the \u201c UniShadowTrade \u201d malware family, are built using the UniApp framework and were first spotted in May. Their names are SBI - INT ( iOS ), Finans Insights ( Android ), Finans Trader6 ( Android ) and a look at the download counter for the last two shows that they were downloaded 5, 000 times. Group - IB also warns that the UniShadow Trade apps can mimick a variety of legitimate cryptocurrency and trading platforms, providing the following extensive list with potential names that could be used in impersonation attempts. The researchers report that the apps were disguised as tools for \" algebraic mathematical formulas and 3D graphics volume area calculations \" on iOS, and as financial news feed aggregators on Android However, after installation they redirected victims to fake trading platforms accessible only via invitation codes. According to the researchers, the fraudsters groomed their victims in conversations over dating apps and used social engineering to gain their trust. The apps requested that users uploaded several documents, such as national IDs and passports, both to add legitimacy to the investment process and also to further empower the threat actors with sensitive information theft. After the removal of the fraudulent apps from the app stores in June, the threat actors moved the distribution operation to phishing websites, showing no signs of stopping. To stay clear from fraudulent investment schemes, it is recommended to do some research before deciding to work with an investment platform, such as checking the background and history ( financial records, past performance, reputation ), or if it is regulated by a locally or globally - recognized authority.

This development comes in response to a critical remote code execution flaw, tracked as CVE - 2024 - 45489, that could have enabled threat actors to launch mass - scale attacks against users of the program. The flaw allowed attackers to exploit how Arc uses Firebase for authentication and database management to execute arbitrary code on a target's browser. A researcher found what they describe as a \" catastrophic \" flaw in the \" Boosts \" ( user - created customizations ) feature that allows users to use JavaScript to modify a website when it is visited. The researcher found that they could cause malicious JavaScript code to run in other users'browsers simply by changing a Boosts'creator ID to another person's ID. When that Arc Browser user visited the site, it would launch the malicious code created by an attacker. Although the flaw was present on the browser for quite a while, it was promptly addressed on August 26, 2024, a day after the researcher responsibly disclosed it to the Arc team, for which they were awarded $ 2, 000. The bug bounty program announced by the Browser Company covers Arc on macOS and Windows and Arc Search on the iOS platform. The set payouts can be summarized in the following four main categories, depending on the severity of the discovered flaws : More details about Arc's Bounty Program are available here. Regarding CVE - 2024 - 45489, the Arc team notes in its latest announcement that auto - syncing of Boosts with JavaScript has been disabled, and a toggle to turn off all Boost - related features has been added on Arc 1. 61. 2, the latest version released on September 26. Also, an audit conducted by an external auditing expert is underway and will cover Arc's backed systems. A new MDM configuration option to disable Boosts for entire organizations will be released in the coming weeks. The Browser Company says new coding guidelines with an elevated focus on auditing and reviewing are now crafted, its incident response process is being revamped for better effectiveness, and new security team members will be welcomed aboard soon.

S. cybersecurity agency CISA is warning about two critical vulnerabilities that allow authentication bypass and remote code execution in Optigo Networks ONS - S8 Aggregation Switch products used in critical infrastructure. The flaws concern weak authentication problems, allowing bypassing of password requirements, and user input validation issues potentially leading to remote code execution, arbitrary file uploads, and directory traversal. The device is used in critical infrastructure and manufacturing units worldwide, and considering that the flaws are remotely exploitable with low attack complexity, the risk is deemed very high. Currently, no fixes are available, so users are recommended to apply suggested mitigations proposed by the Canadian vendor. The first flaw is tracked as CVE - 2024 - 41925 and is classified as a PHP Remote File Inclusion ( RFI ) problem stemming from incorrect validation or sanitation of user - supplied file paths. An attacker could use this vulnerability to perform directory traversal, bypass authentication, and execute arbitrary remote code. The second issue, tracked as CVE - 2024 - 45367, is a weak authentication problem arising from improper password verification enforcement on the authentication mechanism. Exploiting this enables an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the switches'management interface, alter configurations, access sensitive data, or pivot to other network points. Both problems were discovered by Claroty Team82 and are rated as critical, with a CVSS v4 score of 9. 3. The vulnerabilities impact all ONS - S8 Spectra Aggregation Switch versions up to and including 1. 3. 7. While CISA has not seen signs of these flaws being actively exploited, system administrators are recommended to perform the following actions to mitigate the flaws : CISA recommends that organizations observing suspicious activity on these devices follow their breach protocols and report the incident to the cybersecurity agency so that it can be tracked and correlated with other incidents.

The assault consisted of a \u201c month - long \u201d barrage of more than 100 hyper - volumetric DDoS attacks flooding the network infrastructure with garbage data. In a volumetric DDoS attack, the target is overwhelmed with large amounts of data to the point that they consume the bandwidth or exhaust the resources of applications and devices, leaving legitimate users with no access. Many of the attacks aimed at the target \u2019 s network infrastructure ( network and transport layers L3 / 4 ) exceeded two billion packets per second ( pps ) and three terabits per second ( Tbps ). According to researchers at internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, the infected devices were spread across the globe but many of them were located in Russia, Vietnam, the U. S., Brazil, and Spain. The threat actor behind the campaign leveraged multiple types of compromised devices, which included a large number of Asus home routers, Mikrotik systems, DVRs, and web servers. Cloudflare mitigated all the DDoS attacks autonomously and noted that the one peaking at 3. 8 Tbps lasted 65 seconds. The researchers say that the network of malicious devices used mainly the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) on a fixed port, a protocol with fast data transfers but which does not require establishing a formal connection. Previously, Microsoft held the record for defending against the largest volumetric DDoS attack of 3. 47 Tbps, which targeted an Azure customer in Asia. Typically, threat actors launching DDoS attacks rely on large networks of infected devices ( botnets ) or look for ways to amplify the delivered data at the target, which requires a smaller number of systems. In a report this week, cloud computing company Akamai confirmed that the recently disclosed CUPS vulnerabilities in Linux could be a viable vector for DDoS attacks. After scanning the public internet for systems vulnerable to CUPS, Akamai found that more than 58, 000 were exposed to DDoS attacks from exploiting the Linux security issue. More testing revealed that hundreds of vulnerable \u201c CUPS servers will beacon back repeatedly after receiving the initial requests, with some of them appearing to do it endlessly in response to",

Last April this year, FBCS informed of a data breach determined to have occurred between February 14 and February 26, 2024, when threat actors breached its network and stole the following details from its electronic records : The data breach was initially believed to have impacted 1. 9 million people, but subsequent findings upped the tally to 3. 2 million in June and, finally, 4. 2 million individuals in July. The internal investigation into the incident appears to be ongoing, as FBCS recently informed additional entities that they had been impacted, including Comcast and Truist. Also, it is now made known that due to FBCS's worsening financial position, presumably a direct result of the breach, entities indirectly impacted by the incident will have to undertake the notification and remediation processes themselves. Comcast says FBCS assured them in March that the security incident impacted no customer data. However, on July 17, FBCS notified Comcast that its customer data was also impacted. According to a notice submitted to the Maine authorities, 273, 703 Comcast customers were impacted by the breach. \" FBCS's investigation discovered that files downloaded by the unauthorized party included your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, and your Comcast account number and ID numbers used internally at FBCS, \" reads the notification sent to impacted customers. \" FBCS states that it has no indication that any personal information compromised during this incident has been further misused. \" Impacted people were given 12 months of free - of - charge identity theft protection services, with activation instructions enclosed.

The security issue is tracked as CVE - 2024 - 0132 and allows an adversary to perform container escape attacks and gain full access to the host system, where they could execute commands or exfiltrate sensitive information. The particular library comes pre - installed in many AI - focused platforms and virtual machine images and is the standard tool for GPU access when NVIDIA hardware is involved. According to Wiz Research, more than 35 % of cloud environments are at risk of attacks exploiting the vulnerability. The security issue CVE - 2024 - 0132 received a critical - severity score of 9. 0. It is a container escape problem that affects NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1. 16. 1 and earlier, and GPU Operator 24. 6. 1 and older. The problem is a lack of secure isolation of the containerized GPU from the host, allowing containers to mount sensitive parts of the host filesystem or access runtime resources like Unix sockets for inter - process communication. While most filesystems are mounted with \u201c read - only \u201d permissions, certain Unix sockets such as \u2018 docker. sock \u2019 and \u2018 containerd. sock \u2019 remain writable, allowing direct interactions with the host, including command execution. An attacker can take advantage of this omission via a specially crafted container image and reach the host when executed. Wiz says that such an attack could be carried out either directly, via shared GPU resources, or indirectly, when the target runs an image downloaded from a bad source. Wiz researchers discovered the vulnerability and reported it to NVIDIA on September 1st. The GPU maker acknowledged the report a couple of days later, and released a fix on September 26th. Impacted users are recommended to upgrade to NVIDIA Container Toolkit version 1. 16. 2 and NVIDIA GPU Operator 24. 6. 2. Technical details for the exploiting the security issue remain private for now, to give impacted organizations time to mitigate the issue in their environments. However, the researchers are planning to release more technical information.

            "text": "Hackers are actively exploiting a recently disclosed RCE vulnerability in Zimbra email servers that can be triggered simply by sending specially crafted emails to the SMTP server. The Zimbra remote code execution flaw is tracked as CVE - 2024 - 45519 and exists in Zimbra's postjournal service, which is used to parse incoming emails over SMTP. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted emails with commands to execute in the CC field, which are then executed when the postjournal service processes the email. The malicious activity was first reported by HarfangLab's threat researcher Ivan Kwiatkowski, who characterized it as \" mass - exploitation, \" and was subsequently also confirmed by experts at Proofpoint. Proofpoint says they detected the malicious activity on September 28, one day after researchers at Project Discovery released a proof - of - concept exploit. The researchers warn that the attackers are sending emails that spoof Gmail and contain fake email addresses and malicious code in the email's \" CC \" field. If created properly, the Zimbra email server will parse the commands in the CC field and execute them on the server. Specifically, the emails contain base - 64 encoded strings that are executed via the'sh'shell to build and drop a webshell on the Zimbra server. Once the webshell is installed, it listens for inbound connections containing a specific JSESSIONID cookie field. If the correct cookie is detected, the webshell parses another cookie ( JACTION ) that contains base64 - encoded commands to execute. The webshell also supports downloading and executing files on the compromised server. Once installed, the webshell offers full access to the compromised Zimbra server for data theft or to further spread into the internal network. ProjectDiscovery researchers published a technical write - up last week on CVE - 2024 - 45519, including a proof - of - concept ( PoC ) exploit that matches what is seen in the wild now. The researchers reverse - engineered Zimbra's patch to find that the'popen'function, which receives user input, has been replaced with a new function named'execvp,'which features an input sanitization mechanism. Working their way backward, they discovered that it's possible to send SMTP commands to Zimbra's post",

The flaws, which Forescout Research \u2013 Vedere Labs discovered, impact both actively supported and models that have reached end - of - life. However, due to the severity, DrayTek has provided fixes for routers in both categories. The researchers warned that their scans revealed that approximately 785, 000 DrayTek routers might be vulnerable to the newly discovered set of flaws, with over 704, 500 having their web interface exposed to the internet. Most vulnerabilities discovered by Vedere Labs are medium - severity buffer overflow and cross - site scripting problems dictated by several exploitation requirements. However, five of the flaws carry significant risks, requiring immediate attention. Those are summarized as follows : As of yet, there have been no reports of active exploitation of these flaws, and the publication of analytical details has been withheld to allow users enough time to apply the security updates. The above flaws impact 24 router models, of which 11 have reached the end of life yet still received fixes. The impacted models and target firmware versions to upgrade to can be seen in the table below. Users may download the latest firmware for their device model from DrayTek's official download portal. Verdere Labs reports that it found over 704, 500 devices have the DrayTek Vigor Web user interface exposed to the internet, though it should only be accessible from a local network. Nearly half of the devices under Forescout's direct visibility are located in the United States, but Shodan results show significant numbers in the United Kingdom, Vietnam, the Netherlands, and Australia. Apart from applying the latest firmware updates, users are recommended to take the following actions : All DrayTek users should confirm that their device's remote access console is disabled, as exploits and brute force attacks commonly target those services.

The threat actor first emerged in 2021 as a ransomware affiliate for the Sabbath ransomware operation. Later they started to deploy file - encrypting malware from Hive, BlackCat, LockBit, and Hunters International gangs. Recently, they have been observed to deploy the Embargo ransomware. Storm - 0501's recent attacks targeted hospitals, government, manufacturing, and transportation organizations, and law enforcement agencies in the United States. The attacker gains access to cloud environments by exploiting weak credentials and taking advantage of privileged accounts, with the goal of stealing data and executing a ransomware payload. Microsoft explains that the Storm - 0501 obtains initial access to the network with stolen or purchased credentials, or by exploiting known vulnerabilities. Some of the flaws used in recent attacks are CVE - 2022 - 47966 ( Zoho ManageEngine ), CVE - 2023 - 4966 ( Citrix NetScaler ), and possibly CVE - 2023 - 29300 or CVE - 2023 - 38203 ( ColdFusion 2016 ). The adversary moves laterally using frameworks like Impacket and Cobalt Strike, steals data through a custom Rclone binary renamed to mimic a Windows tool, and disables security agents with PowerShell cmdlets. By leveraging stolen Microsoft Entra ID ( formerly Azure AD ) credentials, Storm - 0501 moves from on - premise to cloud environments, compromising synchronization accounts and hijacking sessions for persistence. Microsoft Entra Connect Sync accounts are crucial for synchronizing data between on - premises Active Directory ( AD ) and cloud - based Microsoft Entra ID and typically allow a wide range of sensitive actions. If the attackers possess the credentials for the Directory Synchronization Account, they can use specialized tools like AADInternals to change cloud passwords, thus bypassing additional protections. If a domain admin or other high - privileged on - premises account also exists in the cloud environment and lacks proper protections ( e. g. multi - factor authentication ), Storm - 0501 may use the same credentials to access the cloud again.

            "text": "A new'FakeUpdate'campaign targeting users in France leverages compromised websites to show fake browser and application updates that spread a new version of the WarmCookie backdoor. FakeUpdate is a cyberattack strategy used by a threat group known as'SocGolish'who compromises or creates fake websites to show visitors fake update prompts for a variety of applications, such as web browsers, Java, VMware Workstation, WebEx, and Proton VPN. When users click on update prompts designed to appear legitimate, a fake update is downloaded that drops a malicious payload, like info - stealers, cryptocurrency drainers, RATs, and even ransomware. The latest campaign was discovered by researchers at Gen Threat Labs, who observed the WarmCookie backdoor being distributed as fake Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Java updates. WarmCookie, first discovered by eSentire in mid - 2023, is a Windows backdoor recently seen distributed in phishing campaigns using fake job offers as lures. Its broad capabilities include data and file theft, device profiling, program enumeration ( via the Windows Registry ), arbitrary command execution ( via CMD ), screenshot capturing, and the ability to introduce additional payloads on the infected system. In the latest campaign spotted by Gen Threat Labs, the WarmCookie backdoor has been updated with new features, including running DLLs from the temp folder and sending back the output, as well as the ability to transfer and execute EXE and PowerShell files. The lure used to trigger the infection is a fake browser update, which is common for FakeUpdate attacks. However, Gen Digital also found a site where a fake Java update was promoted in this campaign. The infection chain starts with the user clicking on a fake browser update notice, which triggers JavaScript that fetches the WarmCookie installer and prompts the user to save the file. When the fake software update is executed, the malware performs some anti - VM checks to ensure it's not running on an analyst's environment and sends the newly infected system's fingerprint to the command and control ( C2 ) server, awaiting instructions. Although Gen Threat Labs says the attackers use compromised",

FIN7 is believed to be a Russian hacking group that has been conducting financial fraud and cybercrime since 2013, with ties to ransomware gangs, such as DarkSide, BlackMatter, and BlackCat, who recently conducted an exit scam after stealing a $ 20 million UnitedHealth ransom payment. FIN7 is known for its sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks, such as impersonating BestBuy to send malicious USB keys or creating a fake security company to hire pentesters and developers for ransomware attacks without them knowing. So it's not surprising to find that they have now been linked to an intricate network of websites promoting AI - powered deepnude generators that claim to create fake nude versions of photos of clothed individuals. The technology has been controversial due to the harm it can cause to the subjects by creating non - consensual explicit images, and it has even been outlawed in many places in the world. However, the interest in this technology remains strong. FIN7's fake deepnude sites serve as honeypots for people interested in generating deepfake nudes of celebrities or other people. In 2019, threat actors used a similar lure to spread info - stealing malware even before the AI explosion. The network of deepnude generators operates under the same \" AI Nude \" brand and is promoted through black hat SEO tactics to rank the sites high in search results. According to Silent Push, FIN7 directly operated sites like \" aiNude [. ] ai \", \" easynude [. ] website \", and nude - ai [. ] pro, \" which offered \" free trials \" or \" free downloads, \" but in reality just spread malware. All the sites use a similar design that promises the ability to generate free AI deepnude images from any uploaded photo. The fake websites allow users to upload photos that they would like to create deepfake nudes. However, after the alleged \" deepnude \" is made, it is not displayed on the screen. Instead, the user is prompted to click a link to download the generated image. Doing so will bring the user to another site that displays a password and a link for a password",

Between July 2017 and December 2019, Haotian Sun, Pengfei Xue, and their co - conspirators, Wen Jin Gao and Dian Luo, exploited Apple's device replacement policy to replace non - functioning fake iPhones for genuine devices. Their goal was to \" unjustly enrich themselves by fraudulently obtaining authentic iPhones from Apple after submitting inauthentic iPhones to Apple for repair and replacement, \" according to the court documents. The counterfeit iPhones were shipped from Hong Kong to commercial mail receiving agency ( CMRA ) mailboxes in United Parcel Service ( UPS ) stores in the United States. To open these mailboxes, they used their actual university identification cards and driver's licenses. As discovered by the investigators, they submitted these fake iPhones with spoofed IMEIs and serial numbers to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers. Apple sent them replacement iPhones via private and commercial interstate carriers ( including FedEx, DLH, and UPS ). The devices were then shipped back to Hong Kong, where they were sold, and the proceeds were shared among the conspirators. Their return fraud scheme was possible because Apple customers can return faulty iPhones via mail, at Apple retail stores, or through Apple Authorized Service Providers and exchange them for new ones within one year of purchase under the company's warranty service and handset replacement program. \" Members of the conspiracy submitted more than 6, 000 inauthentic phones to Apple during the conspiracy, causing a loss of more than $ 2. 5 million, \" the Justice Department said in a press release published today. Sun and Xue were arrested by U. S. postal inspectors in December 2019 and were both convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud in February. Sun was sentenced to 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release, while Xue received a 54 - month prison sentence followed by three years of supervised release. The court also ordered them to pay Apple $ 1, 072, 200 and $ 397, 800 in restitution, respectively.

Between Wednesday and Thursday this week, several Google Pay users received the following email about a new card being added to their Google Pay account : For several users including myself, the card in question had been \" expired \" and had not been used in a long time, which led to confusion. Concerned users took to social media and Google's support forums, seeking clarification on these notifications and if they had been victims of a compromise. Google Pay user Arran Dickson reported receiving the \" odd 4am email \" notification about an old expired card and asked Google if this was a cause for concern. Others chimed in, including systems engineer Anthony Parkes, who states having received 15 such emails which made him wonder if he had been hacked. Google's support forums also had the topic \" trending \" with hundreds of upvotes from panicky users. Similar threads [ 1, 2 ] surfaced on Reddit. On Saturday, Google sent out an additional email to impacted users stating that the previous email notification was \" accidental \" and that there was no cause for concern : The subsequent correction sent from the Google Pay team stated : \" You may have received one or more emails about payment methods being added to your Google Account.

S. public companies to access confidential earnings information and conduct insider trading. Westbrook then used this nonpublic information to make trades ahead of 14 earnings announcements between January 2019 and August 2020, earning approximately $ 3, 750, 000 in illicit profits. This activity is known as \u201c insider trading, \u201d where an unauthorized individual makes investments based on confidential information not available to the general public. The British hacker allegedly breached the companies by resetting the passwords of senior executives in the targeted organizations and then hijacking them to access documents or emails containing financial and earnings reports. Access to email accounts would allow the man to easily wipe traces of this activity, including deleting the password reset alerts or using forwarding rules. Additionally, Westbrook used anonymous email accounts, VPN services, and Bitcoin to perform the illegal investments while hiding his identity. However, the SEC says it was still able to track him down using data analytics. Westbrook now faces both civil charges from the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and criminal charges from the U. S. Attorney \u2019 s Office for the District of New Jersey. The SEC charged Westbrook with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, while the criminal charges will likely comprise wire fraud, securities fraud, and unauthorized access to computer systems ( hacking ). The above could carry significant prison sentences, hefty fines, often higher than the profit gained from illicit investment activities, and an order barring Westbrook from trading in securities in the future.

It serves over 17, 500 students across 34 schools in the Burien, Des Moines, Normandy Park, SeaTac, and White Center communities in Washington State. After discovering evidence of unauthorized activity on its network following a September 7 security breach, the school district was forced to shut down all schools and cancel school activities. Highline's central office remained open, and staff were instructed to report for work. The district also started investigating the attack's impact and working to restore systems with help from third - party, state, and federal partners. \" In response, a third - party cybersecurity forensic specialist was engaged, and an investigation was launched, which confirmed that the unauthorized activity was a form of ransomware, \" the school district said this week. \" We notified the FBI of this activity, and we are working to support their investigation. Due to the nature of the investigation, we cannot comment on any potential law enforcement investigation at this time. \" The district is still rebuilding affected network systems to come back online and says it will start re - imaging all student and staff devices starting October 14. \" We are working to rebuild our network systems. Beginning the week of October 14, technology services staff will prompt all staff and students to update their network passwords. Additionally, we will re - image all district - provided Windows devices, \" it added. \" We expect to restore access to several of our network tools during the week of October 14. We are prioritizing access to tools that are authenticated through ClassLink. \" The only devices that won't have to be re - imaged are Chromebooks and Apple devices, although tech staff and students will first have to reset passwords before using them. No other details are available regarding the ransomware operation behind last month's cyberattack, and it's currently unclear whether any personal information belonging to staff or students was exposed or stolen in the incident. However, as a precaution, the district provides all Highline employees one year of free credit and identity monitoring services.

S. presidential election. Iranian nationals Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri, and Yaser Balaghi worked for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) to hack the accounts of current and former U. S. officials, individuals linked to multiple U. S. political campaigns, and media members. According to the DOJ, their attacks were part of a broader Iranian effort attempting to steal sensitive information about American officials and influence U. S. elections. In May 2024, after years of targeting former U. S. government officials, the trio shifted their focus to individuals connected to the Trump presidential campaign, the indictment alleges. They successfully gained unauthorized access to campaign officials'personal accounts, stealing campaign documents and emails. Around late June, the hackers began a \" hack - and - leak \" operation, attempting to leak stolen materials to U. S. media outlets and individuals associated with the Biden campaign, intending to damage Trump's 2024 presidential bid. \" Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden's campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non - public material from former Trump's campaign as text in the emails, \" according to a joint statement released on September 18 by CISA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \" There is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non - public material associated with former President Trump's campaign to U. S. media organizations. \" Their \" hack - and - leak \" operation started in January 2020 and involved spearphishing and social engineering tactics. By 2022, they expanded their efforts and targeted a former U. S. government official to steal personal information that could help identify future victims. Iranian nationals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have been indicted for a \" hack - and - leak \" operation targeting the 2024 U.

JPCERT / CC says the technique can be valuable when responding to ransomware attacks, and identifying the attack vector among various possibilities is crucial for timely mitigation. The investigation strategy proposed by JPCERT / CC covers four types of Windows Event Logs : Application, Security, System, and Setup logs. These logs often contain traces left behind by ransomware attacks that could reveal the entry points used by the attackers and their \" digital identity. \" Here are some examples of ransomware traces highlighted in the agency's report : JPCERT / CC also notes that seemingly unrelated ransomware variants such as Shade, GandCrab, AKO, AvosLocker, BLACKBASTA, and Vice Society, leave behind very similar traces ( event IDs : 13, 10016 ). Both errors are caused by a lack of permissions when accessing COM applications to delete Volume Shadow Copies, which ransomware typically deletes to prevent easy restoration of encrypted files. It's important to note that no detection method should be taken as a guarantee for adequate protection against ransomware, but monitoring for specific logs can prove game - changing when combined with other measures to detect attacks before they spread too far into a network. JPCERT / CC notes that older ransomware strains such as WannaCry and Petya did not leave traces in Windows logs, but the situation has changed on modern malware, so the technique is now considered effective. In 2022, SANS also shared a guide on detecting different ransomware families using Windows Event Logs.

            "text": "A Linux malware named \" perfctl \" has been targeting Linux servers and workstations for at least three years, remaining largely undetected through high levels of evasion and the use of rootkits. According to Aqua Nautilus researchers who discovered perfctl, the malware likely targeted millions of Linux servers in recent years and possibly caused infections in several thousands of them. This is based on numerous reports by victims of the malware submitted to online discussion forums, all containing indicators of compromise exclusively associated with perfctl activity. According to Aqua Nautilus, the primary purpose of perfctl is for cryptomining, using the compromised servers to mine the hard - to - trace Monero cryptocurrency. However, it could be easily used for more damaging operations. Aqua Nautilus believes that the threat actors exploit misconfigurations or exposed secrets to breach Linux servers. These misconfigurations range from publicly accessible files that contain credentials to exposed login interfaces. The researchers have also observed exploitation of CVE - 2023 - 33246, a remote command execution impacting Apache RocketMQ versions 5. 1. 0 and older, and CVE - 2021 - 4034 ( PwnKit ), an elevation of privilege flaw in Polkit. Once initial access is established, the packed and obfuscated payload, named \" httpd, \" is downloaded from the attacker's server and executed. It then copies itself in the / tmp directory under the \" sh \" name and then deletes the original binary. The new process assumes the same name ( \" sh \" ), essentially blending with normal Linux system operations. Additional copies are created in other system locations, such as \" / root /. config, \" \" / usr / bin / \" and \" usr / lib \" to ensure persistence in the case of a cleanup. When launched, perfctl opens a Unix socket for internal communications and establishes an encrypted channel with the threat actor's servers over TOR, making it impossible to decipher the exchange. It then drops a rootkit named'libgcwrap. so'which hooks into various system functions to modify authentication mechanisms and intercept network traffic as needed to facilitate evasion. Additional userland rootkits are also deployed, replacing the ldd, top",

The flaw, discovered by Akamai's Aline Eliovich, is tracked as CVE - 2024 - 7029 and is a high - severity ( CVSS v4 score : 8. 7 ) issue in the \" brightness \" function of the cameras, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject commands over the network using specially crafted requests. Specifically, the easy - to - exploit flaw lies in the \" brightness \" argument in the \" action = \" parameter of the AVTECH cameras'firmware, intended to allow remote adjustments to the brightness of a camera. The flaw impacts all AVTECH AVM1203 IP cameras running on firmware versions up to Fullmg - 1023 - 1007 - 1011 - 1009. Due to the impacted models no longer being supported by the Taiwanese vendor, having reached their end of life ( EoL ) in 2019, no patch is available to address CVE - 2024 - 7029, and no fixes are expected to be released. The U. S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an advisory at the start of the month to warn about CVE - 2024 - 7029 and the availability of public exploits, warning that the cameras are still used in commercial facilities, financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation systems. Proof of concept ( PoC ) exploits for the particular flaw have been available since at least 2019, but a CVE was only assigned this month, and no active exploitation had been observed previously. Corona is a Mirai - based variant that has been around since at least 2020, exploiting various vulnerabilities in IoT devices to propagate. Akamai's SIRT team reports that starting on March 18, 2024, Corona began leveraging CVE - 2024 - 7029 in attacks in the wild, targeting AVM1203 cameras still in service despite them having reached EoL five years ago. The first active campaign we observed began on March 18, 2024, but analysis showed activity for this variant as early as December 2023. The proof of concept ( PoC ) for CVE - 202",

The Defender privacy protection feature ( also known as Defender VPN ) protects your privacy and security when connected to public Wi - Fi or an untrusted network, where your data and identity could be exposed or stolen. To do that, it encrypts and routes your internet traffic through Microsoft's servers and hides your internet address ( IP address ) using a VPN ( Virtual Private Network ). Microsoft announced today that Defender VPN has been upgraded to automatically alert users they're exposed to attacks and can now be configured to enable automatically for better safety. \" We've added detection for un - safe Wi - Fi ( suspicious Wi - Fi ). These detections are possible using Defender heuristics that examine multiple characteristics of a Wi - Fi hotspot to determine if it is suspicious, \" Microsoft said. \" As with unsecure Wi - Fi, you get a notification for un - safe Wi - Fi as well and can turn on Defender VPN for added safety. \" This can help defend you against attackers setting up a rogue wireless access point to trick users into connecting to it in Evil Twin attacks. After the victims connect, they can steal sensitive information in Man - in - the - Middle ( MiTM ) attacks or use phishing techniques to get more information. The unsafe Wi - Fi alerts are now only available in Defender for Android, iOS, and Windows, with macOS support also to roll out soon. The company has also added support for Defender VPN on Windows and macOS systems and made it available in Germany and Canada. More countries will be added in the upcoming months. \" We're adding privacy protection to ten additional countries in Europe, Asia, and LATAM regions soon, \" said Microsoft. First introduced one year ago in September 2023 on Android devices in the United States, privacy protection is a feature included with Microsoft Defender for individuals. It's important to note that Microsoft says that Defender VPN will send anonymized service data to the company's servers but won't collect browsing data, history, personal details, or your device's physical location. This anonymized service data contains details like the duration of the VPN's use, the amount of VPN bandwidth",

MoneyGram confirmed they had suffered a cyberattack and took systems offline to contain the breach on September 20, three days after customers started reporting experiencing issues. The disruption to IT systems prevented customers from being able to access and transfer their money and perform other online activities. While many suspected it was a ransomware attack, MoneyGram shared no further details, and no ransomware gangs claimed responsibility. In an email with updated information about the cyberattack sent to stakeholders on September 25 and seen by BleepingComputer, MoneyGram said that customers are finally able to transfer funds again. MoneyGram confirmed that corporate systems were breached, but after investigating the attack with CrowdStrike, law enforcement, and other cybersecurity professionals said there was no evidence that ransomware was behind the attack. \" After working with leading external cybersecurity experts, including CrowdStrike, and coordinating with U. S. law enforcement, the majority of our systems are now operational, and we have resumed money transfer services, \" says an email obtained by BleepingComputer. \" We recognize the importance of system security as we take these actions.

As Microsoft security researchers observed, the threat group ( also tracked as Peach Sandstorm and Refined Kitten ), which operates on behalf of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ), used this new malware as part of an intelligence collection campaign between April and July 2024. Throughout these attacks, the threat actors leveraged Microsoft Azure infrastructure for command - and - control ( C2 ), using fraudulent, attacker - controlled Azure subscriptions that the company has since disrupted. APT33 breached targeted organizations in the defense, space, education, and government sectors following successful password spray attacks between April and May 2024. In these attacks, they attempted to gain access to many accounts using a small number of commonly used passwords to avoid triggering account lockouts. \" While the password spray activity appeared consistently across sectors, Microsoft observed Peach Sandstorm exclusively leveraging compromised user accounts in the education sector to procure operational infrastructure. In these cases, the threat actor accessed existing Azure subscriptions or created one using the compromised account to host their infrastructure, \" Microsoft said. The Azure infrastructure they gained control of was used in subsequent operations targeting the government, defense, and space sectors. \" In the past year, Peach Sandstorm has successfully compromised several organizations, primarily in the aforementioned sectors, using bespoke tooling, \" Microsoft added. The Iranian threat group also used this tactic in November 2023 to compromise the networks of defense contractors worldwide and deploy FalseFont backdoor malware. In September, Microsoft warned of another APT33 campaign that had targeted thousands of organizations worldwide in extensive password spray attacks since February 2023, leading to breaches in the defense, satellite, and pharmaceutical sectors. Microsoft has announced that starting October 15, multi - factor authentication ( MFA ) will be mandatory for all Azure sign - in attempts to protect Azure accounts against phishing and hijacking attempts. The company has previously found that MFA allows 99. 99 % of MFA - enabled accounts to resist hacking attempts and reduces the risk of compromise by 98. 56 %, even when attackers attempt to breach accounts using previously compromised credentials.

            "text": "A new malware campaign is spreading a previously undocumented backdoor named \" Voldemort \" to organizations worldwide, impersonating tax agencies from the U. S., Europe, and Asia. As per a Proofpoint report, the campaign started on August 5, 2024, and has disseminated over 20, 000 emails to over 70 targeted organizations, reaching 6, 000 in a single day at the peak of its activity. Over half of all targeted organizations are in the insurance, aerospace, transportation, and education sectors. The threat actor behind this campaign is unknown, but Proofpoint believes the most likely objective is to conduct cyber espionage. The attack is similar to what Proofpoint described at the start of the month but involved a different malware set in the final stage. A new Proofpoint report says the attackers are crafting phishing emails to match a targeted organization's location based on public information. The phishing emails impersonate taxing authorities from the organization's country, stating that there is updated tax information and includes links to associated documents. Clicking on the link brings recipients to a landing page hosted on InfinityFree, which uses Google AMP Cache URLs to redirect the victim to a page with a \" Click to view document \" button. When the button is clicked, the page will check the browser's User Agent, and if it's for Windows, redirect the target to a search - ms URI ( Windows Search Protocol ) that points to a TryCloudflare - tunneled URI. Non - Windows users are redirected to an empty Google Drive URL that serves no malicious content. If the victim interacts with the search - ms file, Windows Explorer is triggered to display a LNK or ZIP file disguised as a PDF. The use of the search - ms : URI has become popular lately with phishing campaigns as even though this file is hosted on an external WebDAV / SMB share, it is made to appear as if it resides locally in the Downloads folder to trick the victim into opening it. Doing so executes a Python script from another WebDAV share without downloading it on the host, which performs system info collection to profile the victim. At the same time, a decoy PDF is displayed to obscure the malicious activity. The script also downloads a legitimate",

Citrine Sleet targets financial institutions, focusing on cryptocurrency organizations and associated individuals, and has been previously linked to Bureau 121 of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. The North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites camouflaged as legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect potential victims with fake job applications or weaponized cryptocurrency wallets or trading apps. UNC4736 trojanized the Electron - based desktop client of video conferencing software maker 3CX in March 2023, following a previous supply - chain attack in which they breached the site of Trading Technologies, a stock trading automation company, to push trojanized X _ TRADER software builds. Google's Threat Analysis Group ( TAG ) also linked AppleJeus to the compromise of Trading Technologies'website in a March 2022 report. The U.

The studio is best known for creating the Outlast series, a popular survival horror franchise with its third and latest installment, The Outlast Trials, released in March 2024. This title is specifically mentioned in the Red Barrels announcement, presumably to prepare players for delays in the delivery of patches, updates, and new content. The team previously teased Outlast 3, indicating they were already developing the next installment. While no release date has been confirmed, recent events will naturally affect the production timeline. \" The hit on our production timeline has been significant. We will do our best to follow our roadmap, but unfortunately, some things will have to be delayed, \" continued Red Barrel's statement. The gaming studio says its investigation into the incident has been completed, and the breach has been contained, promising to continue implementing security measures that will protect its players'and internal data. It is unclear if the hackers who performed the attack stole game source code or other assets related to upcoming projects that could damage the studio if leaked publicly.

The critical flaw impacts the following products : Website security company Sansec has been tracking the attacks since June 2024 and observed 4, 275 stores breached in CosmicSting attacks, high - profile victims including Whirlpool, Ray - Ban, National Geographic, Segway, and Cisco, which BleepingComputer reported last month. Sansec says that multiple threat actors are now conducting attacks as patching speed is not matching the critical nature of the situation. \" Sansec projects that more stores will get hacked in the coming months, as 75 % of the Adobe Commerce & Magento install base hadn't patched when the automated scanning for secret encryption keys started, \" warns Sansec. As Sansec had predicted, when CosmicSting was disclosed with little technical details and an urgent notice to apply the security updates, it announced one of the worst threats to the e - commerce ecosystem.

This joint action also led to seizures of LockBit infrastructure servers and involved police officers in Operation Cronos, a task force led by the U. K. National Crime Agency ( NCA ) behind a global LockBit crackdown and an investigation that began in April 2022. According to Europol, a suspected LockBit ransomware developer was arrested in August 2024 at the request of French authorities while on holiday outside of Russia. The same month, the U. K.'s National Crime Agency ( NCA ) arrested two more individuals linked to LockBit activity : one believed to be associated with a LockBit affiliate, while the second was apprehended on suspicion of money laundering. In a separate action, at Madrid airport, Spain's Guardia Civil arrested the administrator of a bulletproof hosting service used to shield LockBit's infrastructure. Today, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States also revealed sanctions against an individual the UK NCA believes is a prolific LockBit ransomware affiliate linked to Evil Corp. The United Kingdom sanctioned 15 more Russian nationals involved in Evil Corp's criminal activities, while the United States sanctioned six individuals and Australia targeted two. \" These actions follow the massive disruption of LockBit infrastructure in February 2024, as well as the large series of sanctions and operational actions that took place against LockBit administrators in May and subsequent months, \" Europol said. LockBit emerged in September 2019 and has since claimed responsibility for and been linked to attacks against many high - profile companies and organizations worldwide, including Bank of America, Boeing, the Continental automotive giant, the Italian Internal Revenue Service, and the UK Royal Mail. In February 2024, Operation Cronos shut down LockBit's infrastructure and seized 34 servers containing over 2, 500 decryption keys that were later used to create a free LockBit 3. 0 Black Ransomware decryptor. The U. S. Department of Justice and the UK NCA estimate that the gang has extorted up to $ 1 billion following at least 7, 000 attacks between June 2022 and February 2024. Previous charges and arrests of cybercriminals linked to the Lockbit ransomware gang include Mikhail Pavlovich",

            "text": "The malicious PoorTry kernel - mode Windows driver used by multiple ransomware gangs to turn off Endpoint Detection and Response ( EDR ) solutions has evolved into an EDR wiper, deleting files crucial for the operation of security solutions and making restoration harder. Though Trend Micro had warned about this functionality added on Poortry since May 2023, Sophos has now confirmed seeing the EDR wiping attacks in the wild. This evolution of PoorTry from an EDR deactivator to an EDR wiper represents a very aggressive shift in tactics by ransomware actors, who now prioritize a more disruptive setup phase to ensure better outcomes in the encryption stage. PoorTry, also known as'BurntCigar,'was developed in 2021 as a kernel - mode driver to disable EDR and other security software. The kit, used by several ransomware gangs, including BlackCat, Cuba, and LockBit, first gained attention when its developers found ways to get their malicious drivers signed through Microsoft's attestation signing process. Other cybercrime groups, such as Scattered Spider, were also seen utilizing the tool in breaches focused on credential theft and SIM - swapping attacks. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Poortry continued to evolve, optimizing its code and using obfuscation tools like VMProtect, Themida, and ASMGuard to pack the driver and its loader ( Stonestop ) for evasion. The latest report by Sophos is based on a RansomHub attack in July 2024 that employed Poortry to delete critical executable files ( EXEs ), dynamic link libraries ( DLLs ), and other essential components of security software. This ensures that EDR software cannot be recovered or restarted by defenders, leaving the system completely unprotected in the following encryption phase of the attack. The process starts with the user - mode component of PoorTry, identifying the security software's installation directories and the critical files within those directories. It then sends requests to the kernel - mode component to systematically terminate security - related processes and then delete their crucial files. Paths to those files are hardcoded onto PoorTry, while the user - mode component supports deletion either by file name or type, giving it some operational flexibility to cover a broader range of",

In an announcement published on its website late last week, UMC disclosed it is responding to an IT outage impacting its network. While facilities remain open, some emergency and non - emergency cases are being diverted. The cause of the IT outage, according to the healthcare organization, was a ransomware attack. As of publication, no major ransomware groups have assumed responsibility for the attack at UMC, so the attackers are unknown. UMC is a large healthcare provider operating 30 clinics across West Texas and Eastern New Mexico, which are visited by 400, 000 patients annually. Being the only'Level 1 Trauma Center'within 400 miles, the UMC Health System in Lubbock plays a critical role for patients in need of urgent surgical care. The hospital is making accommodations to lessen the impact of the ransomware attack. However, certain departments remain closed or can only provide services with significant delays, with radiology being one of those. Medical prescription lists are unavailable at the UMC clinics due to the IT system outage, so patients are advised to bring them with them when visiting. Medical records are available on the patient portal, but UMC says they cannot be printed now. Finally, establishing communication over the phone or online portal cannot be guaranteed at this point, so those in need of immediate assistance are advised to visit a clinic. Ransomware attacks are typically accompanied by data theft, and in this case, the sensitive medical information of hundreds of thousands could be impacted. UMC has not touched the subject in its latest status update and noted that the investigation into the security incident is still ongoing, and updates will be provided when more information becomes available.

As Akamai security researchers found, a CVE - 2024 - 47176 security flaw in the cups - browsed daemon that can be chained with three other bugs to gain remote code execution on Unix - like systems via a single UDP packet can also be leveraged to amplify DDoS attacks. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker sends a specially crafted packet, tricking a CUPS server into treating a target as a printer to be added. Each packet sent to vulnerable CUPS servers prompts them to generate larger IPP / HTTP requests aimed at the targeted device. This impacts both the target and the CUPS server, consuming their bandwidth and CPU resources. To initiate such an attack, a malicious actor only needs to send a single packet to an exposed and vulnerable CUPS service exposed online. Akamai researchers estimate that around 58, 000 servers, out of over 198, 000 exposed devices, could be recruited for DDoS attacks. Furthermore, hundreds of vulnerable devices demonstrated an \" infinite loop \" of requests, with some CUPS servers repeatedly sending requests after receiving an initial probe and some servers entering an endless loop in response to specific HTTP / 404 errors. Many of these vulnerable machines were running outdated versions of CUPS ( going as far back as 2007 ), which are easy targets for cybercriminals who can exploit them to build botnets via the RCE chain or use them for DDoS amplification. \" In the worst - case scenario, we observed what appeared to be an endless stream of attempted connections and requests as a result of a single probe. These flows appear to have no end, and will continue until the daemon is killed or restarted, \" the Akamai researchers said. \" Many of these systems we observed in testing established thousands of requests, sending them to our testing infrastructure. In some cases, this behavior appeared to continue indefinitely. \" This DDoS amplification attack also requires minimal resources and little time to execute. Akamai warns that a threat actor could easily take control of every exposed CUPS service on the internet in seconds. Admins are advised to deploy CVE -",

Columbus, the capital and most populous ( 2, 140, 000 ) city in Ohio, suffered a ransomware attack on July 18, 2024, which caused various service outages and unavailability of email and IT connectivity between public agencies. At the end of July, the City's administration announced that no systems had been encrypted, but they were looking into the possibility that sensitive data might have been stolen in the attack. On the same day, Rhysida ransomware claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging they stole 6. 5 TB of databases, including employee credentials, server dumps, city video camera feeds, and other sensitive information. On August 8, after failing to extort the City, the threat actors published 45 % of stolen data comprising 260, 000 files ( 3. 1 TB ), exposing much of what they previously claimed to be holding. According to the City's complaint, the exposed dataset includes two backup databases containing large amounts of data gathered by the local prosecutors and police force, dating back to at least 2015, containing, among other things, the personal information of undercover officers. On the day of the data leak on Rhysida's extortion portal on the dark web, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther stated on local media that the disclosed information was neither valuable nor usable and that the attack had been successfully thwarted. A few hours later, Goodwolf disputed the Mayor's claim that no sensitive or valuable data was exposed by sharing information with the media about what the leaked dataset included. In response to this, on August 12, Mayor Ginther claimed that the exposed data was \" encrypted or corrupted, \" so the leak is unusable and should be of no concern to the public. However, Goodwolf disputed these claims, sharing samples of the data with the media to illustrate that it contained unencrypted personal data of people in Columbus. \" Among the details laid bare were names from domestic violence cases, and Social Security numbers for police officers and crime victims alike. The dump not only impacts city employees, but also revealed personal information for residents and visitors going back years, \" reported NBC4.

            "text": "Security researchers have found a vulnerability in a key air transport security system that allowed unauthorized individuals to potentially bypass airport security screenings and gain access to aircraft cockpits. Researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered the vulnerability in FlyCASS, a third - party web - based service that some airlines use to manage the Known Crewmember ( KCM ) program and the Cockpit Access Security System ( CASS ). KCM is a Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) initiative that allows pilots and flight attendants to skip security screening, and CASS enables authorized pilots to use jumpseats in cockpits when traveling. The KCM system, operated by ARINC ( a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace ), verifies airline employees'credentials through an online platform. The process involves scanning a KCM barcode or entering an employee number, then cross - checking with the airline's database to grant access without requiring a security screening. Similarly, the CASS system verifies pilots for cockpit jumpseat access when they need to commute or travel. The researchers discovered that FlyCASS's login system was susceptible to SQL injection, a vulnerability that enables attackers to insert SQL statements for malicious database queries. By exploiting this flaw, they could log in as an administrator for a participating airline, Air Transport International, and manipulate employee data within the system. They added a fictitious employee, \" Test TestOnly, \" and granted this account access to KCM and CASS, which effectively allowed them to \" skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners. \" \" Anyone with basic knowledge of SQL injection could login to this site and add anyone they wanted to KCM and CASS, allowing themselves to both skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners, \" Carroll said. Realizing the severity of the issue, the researchers immediately began a disclosure process, contacting the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) on April 23, 2024. The researchers decided not to contact the FlyCASS site directly as it appeared to be run by a single person and were afraid the disclosure would alarm them. The DHS responded, acknowledging the seriousness of the vulnerability, and confirmed that FlyCASS was disconnected from the KCM / CASS system on May 7, 2024, as a precautionary measure. Soon after, the vulnerability was fixed on FyCASS. However, efforts to further coordinate a safe disclosure",

The activity was discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group ( TAG ), who said the n - day flaws have already been patched but remain effective on devices that have not been updated. APT29, also known as \" Midnight Blizzard \", targeted multiple websites of the Mongolian government and employed \" watering hole \" tactics. A watering hole is a cyberattack where a legitimate site is compromised with malicious code designed to deliver payloads to visitors that meet specific criteria, like device architecture or location ( IP - based ). Interestingly, TAG notes that APT29 used exploits that were almost identical to those used by commercial surveillance - ware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa, who created and leveraged the flaws as zero days when no fix was available. Google's threat analysts note that APT29 has a long history of exploiting zero - day and n - day vulnerabilities. In 2021, the Russian cyber - operatives exploited CVE - 2021 - 1879 as a zero - day, targeting government officials in Eastern Europe, attempting to deliver a cookie - stealing framework that snatched LinkedIn, Gmail, and Facebook accounts. In November 2023, APT29 compromised Mongolian government sites'mfa. gov [. ] mn'and'cabinet. gov [. ] mn'to add a malicious iframe that delivered an exploit for CVE - 2023 - 41993. This is an iOS WebKit flaw that APT29 leveraged for stealing browser cookies from iPhone users running iOS 16. 6. 1 and older. TAG reports that this exploit was exactly the same as the one Intellexa used in September 2023, leveraging CVE - 2023 - 41993 as a zero - day vulnerability at the time. In February 2024, APT29 compromised another Mongolian government website,'mga. gov [. ] mn,'to inject a new iframe delivering the same exploit.

WPS Office is a productivity suite developed by the Chinese firm Kingsoft that is popular in Asia. Reportedly, it has over 500 million active users worldwide. The zero - day flaw, tracked as CVE - 2024 - 7262, has been leveraged in attacks in the wild since at least late February 2024, but impacts versions from 12. 2. 0. 13110 ( August 2023 ) to 12. 1. 0. 16412 ( March 2024 ). Kingsoft \" silently \" patched the problem in March this year without informing the customers that the flaw was actively exploited, prompting ESET, who discovered the campaign and vulnerability, to publish a detailed report today. In addition to CVE - 2024 - 7262, ESET's investigation unveiled a second severe flaw, tracked as CVE - 2024 - 7263, which Kingsoft patched in late May 2024 with version 12. 2. 0. 17119. CVE - 2024 - 7262 resides in how the software handles custom protocol handlers, specifically'ksoqing : / /,'which allows the execution of external applications through specially crafted URLs within documents. Due to improper validation and sanitization of these URLs, the flaw allows attackers to craft malicious hyperlinks that lead to arbitrary code execution. APT - C - 60 created spreadsheet documents ( MHTML files ) where they embedded malicious hyperlinks hidden under a decoy image to trick the victim into clicking them, triggering the exploit. The processed URL parameters include a base64 - encoded command to execute a specific plugin ( promecefpluginhost. exe ) that attempts to load a malicious DLL ( ksojscore. dll ) containing the attacker's code. This DLL is APT - C - 60's downloader component, designed for fetching the final payload ( TaskControler. dll ) from the attacker's server, a custom backdoor named'SpyGlace.'SpyGlace is a backdoor previously analyzed by Threatbook",

It plays a significant role in managing and processing radioactive materials, handling more nuclear waste in one location than any other facility worldwide. The site is involved in retrieving nuclear waste, fuel, and sludge from legacy ponds and silos, storing radioactive materials such as plutonium and uranium, managing spent nuclear fuel rods, and remediating and decommissioning nuclear facilities. Sellafield is a critical unit for the UK's nuclear waste management system, so its IT systems security is vital to ensure safe operations. Last year, a series of investigations by The Guardian into Sellafield's cybersecurity brought attention to multiple severe issues, revealing that contractors had easy access to critical systems where they, among other things, could install USB drives. Additionally, well - known vulnerabilities within the facility abound, giving the site the nickname \" Voldemort \" by people working there. An audit from French security firm Atos revealed that roughly 75 % of Sellafield's servers were vulnerable to attacks with potentially catastrophic consequences. The nuclear site's operators pleaded guilty in June 2024 to their failure to comply with standard IT security regulations, admitting their failure. ONR investigated these reports, and while it confirmed that Sellafield failed to abide by the cybersecurity standards that underpin the operation of such sites in the UK, it says it found no evidence that the vulnerabilities were leveraged in attacks. This contrasts previous reports by the press that Russian and Chinese hackers allegedly planted malware on the site, and that security breaches occurred as far back as 2015. \" An investigation by ONR [.",
