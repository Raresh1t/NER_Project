Broadcom warned customers today about three VMware zero-days, tagged as exploited in attacks and reported by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center. The vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, and CVE-2025-22226) impact VMware ESX products, including VMware ESXi, vSphere, Workstation, Fusion, Cloud Foundation, and Telco Cloud Platform. Attackers with privileged administrator or root access can chain these flaws to escape the virtual machine's sandbox. "This is a situation where an attacker who has already compromised a virtual machine's guest OS and gained privileged access (administrator or root) could move into the hypervisor itself," the company explained today. "Broadcom has information to suggest that exploitation of these issues has occurred 'in the wild'." Broadcom says CVE-2025-22224 is a critical-severity VCMI heap overflow vulnerability that enables local attackers with administrative privileges on the targeted VM to execute code as the VMX process running on the host. CVE-2025-22225 is an ESXi arbitrary write vulnerability that allows the VMX process to trigger arbitrary kernel writes, leading to a sandbox escape, while CVE-2025-22226 is described as an HGFS information-disclosure flaw that lets threat actors with admin permissions to leak memory from the VMX process. When asked if Microsoft had more information regarding the flaws' in-the-wild exploitation, a spokesperson told BleepingComputer the company "does not have anything additional to share at this time." VMware vulnerabilities are often targeted in attacks by ransomware gangs and state-sponsored hacking groups because they are commonly used in enterprise operations to store or transfer sensitive corporate data. Most recently, ​Broadcom warned in November that attackers were actively exploiting two VMware vCenter Server vulnerabilities that were patched in September. One allows privilege escalation to root (CVE-2024-38813) while the other is a critical remote code execution flaw (CVE-2024-38812) reported during China's 2024 Matrix Cup hacking contest. In January 2024, Broadcom also revealed that Chinese state hackers had exploited a critical vCenter Server vulnerability (CVE-2023-34048) as a zero-day since at least late 2021 to deploy VirtualPita and VirtualPie backdoors on vulnerable ESXi hosts.
