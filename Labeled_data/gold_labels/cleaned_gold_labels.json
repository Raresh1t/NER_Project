        "text": "A new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation named Cicada3301 has already listed 19 victims on its extortion portal, as it quickly attacked companies worldwide. The new cybercrime operation is named after the mysterious 2012-2014 online/real-world game that involved elaborate cryptographic puzzles and used the same logo for promotion on cybercrime forums. However, there's no connection between the two, and the legitimate project has issued a statement to renounce any association and condemn the ransomware operators' actions. The Cicada3301 RaaS first began promoting the operation and recruiting affiliates on June 29, 2024, in a forum post to the ransomware and cybercrime forum known as RAMP. However, BleepingComputer is aware of Cicada attacks as early as June 6, indicating that the gang was operating independently before attempting to recruit affiliates. Like other ransomware operations, Cicada3301 conducts double-extortion tactics where they breach corporate networks, steal data, and then encrypt devices. The encryption key and threats to leak stolen data are then used as leverage to scare victims into paying a ransom. The threat actors operate a data leak site that is used as part of their double-extortion scheme. An analysis of the new malware by Truesec revealed significant overlaps between Cicada3301 and ALPHV/BlackCat, indicating a possible rebrand or a fork created by former ALPHV's core team members. This is based on the fact that: For context, ALPHV performed an exit scam in early March 2024 involving fake claims about an FBI takedown operation after they stole a massive $22 million payment from Change Healthcare from one of their affiliates. Truesec has also found indications that the Cicada3301 ransomware operation may partner with or utilize the Brutus botnet for initial access to corporate networks. That botnet was previously associated with global-scale VPN brute-forcing activities targeting Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, and SonicWall appliances. It's worth noting that the Brutus activity was first spotted two weeks after ALPHV shut down operations, so the link between the two groups still stands in terms of timelines. Cicada3301 is a Rust-based ransomware operation with both Windows and Linux/VMware ESXi encryptors. As part of Truesec's report, the researchers analyzed the VMWare ESXi Linux encryptor for the ransomware operation. Like BlackCat and other ransomware families, such as RansomHub, a special key must be entered as a command line argument to launch the encryptor. This key is used to decrypt an encrypted JSON blob that contains the configuration that the encryptor will use when encrypting a device. Truesec says that the encryptor checks for the validity of the key by using it to decrypt the ransom note and, if successful, continues with the rest of the encryption operation. Its main function (linux_enc) uses the ChaCha20 stream cipher for file encryption and then encrypts the symmetric key used in the process with an RSA key. The encryption keys are generated randomly using the 'OsRng' function. Cicada3301 targets specific file extensions matching documents and media files and checks their size to determine where to apply intermittent encryption (>100MB) and where to encrypt the entire file contents (<100MB). When encrypting files, the encryptor will append a random seven-character extension to the file name and create ransom notes named 'RECOVER-[extension]-DATA.txt,' as shown below. It should be noted that BlackCat/ALPHV encryptors also used random seven-character extensions and a ransom note named 'RECOVER-[extension]-FILES.txt.' The ransomware's operators can set a sleep parameter to delay the encryptor's execution, potentially to evade immediate detection. A \"no_vm_ss\" parameter also orders the malware to encrypt VMware ESXi virtual machines without attempting to shut them down first. However, by default, Cicada3301 first uses ESXi's 'esxcli' and 'vim-cmd' commands to shut down virtual machines and delete their snapshots before encrypting data. Cicada3301's activities and rate of success indicate an experienced actor who knows what they're doing, further supporting the hypothesis of an ALPHV reboot or at least utilizing affiliates with prior ransomware experience. The new ransomware's focus on ESXi environments highlights its strategic design to maximize damage in enterprise environments that many threat actors now target for lucrative profits. By combining file encryption with the ability to disrupt VM operations and remove recovery options, Cicada3301 ensures a high-impact attack that affects entire networks and infrastructures, maximizing the pressure placed on victims.

Docker-OSX is an open-source project created by security researcher Sick.Codes that allows for the virtualization of macOS on non-Apple hardware. It can be hosted on any system that supports Docker, including Linux and Windows. The project is useful for developers who need to test software on macOS or security researchers trying out various configurations to uncover bugs or to research malware. Its popularity is reflected in its 750,000 downloads and 500 stars on Docker Hub, as well as its 40,000 stars on GitHub. On Wednesday, Docker-OSX users reported that they were unable to pull the latest macOS images from the Docker Hub repository, getting 404 errors. \"docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for sickcodes/docker-osx, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied,\" read an error message when a user tried to install the image. After other users reported a similar issue accessing the Docker image, the developer, Sick.Codes, replied that it was gone from their account and have received no information as to why. After posting about the removal on X, Docker confirmed it with Sick.Codes that the image was removed after they received a DMCA takedown request from Apple. In the DMCA request sent to Sick.Codes and shared with BleepingComputer, a law firm representing Apple asserted that the \"docker-osx\" repository contains images of Apple's macOS installer, which are protected by copyright. The notice specifies that Docker-OSX reproduces Apple's content without authorization, which constitutes copyright infringement under U.S. law, and requests that Docker act \"expeditiously\" to take down the repository. \"It has come to our attention that images of Apple's macOS installer and installation have been posted at https://hub.docker.com/r/sickcodes/docker-osx,\" reads the DMCA infringement notification sent by Apple's lawyers at Kilpatrick, Townsend and Stockton LLP. \"Apple has exclusive rights in its macOS installer and installation. See macOS Sonoma. Docker-OSX reproduces this content without authorization. The unauthorized reproduction of Apple's content constitutes copyright infringement and is a violation of the DMCA.\" From a legal perspective, Apple's actions are justified in this case, as its EULA for macOS restricts the use of the operating system to Apple-branded hardware, and enforcement of these licensing terms is within its rights. Sick.Codes told BleepingComputer that Apple's action would primarily impact security researchers using Docker-OSX to help make macOS safer. \"Every time I'm at a security conference, like DEFCON or http://Hardwear.io, other researchers come up and say that they used Docker-OSX to do bug bounty. It's essentially one of the one ways to participate in Apple's bug bounty program without an actual Mac,\" explained Sick.Codes. Sick.Codes added that Apple contradicts itself by encouraging security research contributions and bug reports but targets the projects that help researchers perform this activity. With that said, the researcher says his devotion to help in Apple security research remains unwavering. \"This is a legitimate good-faith security research project that I, and over 700,000 others, have used to try and find bugs in macOS. They [Apple] explicitly permit researchers to test their products as part of the Apple Bug Bounty program, of which I am a participant and have submitted bugs to Apple before. And will continue to do so.\" Meanwhile, Docker-OSX remains available on GitHub at the time of writing, but the repository there only contains the project's code, not the installer binaries, so Sick.Codes does not expect a DMCA request there. Ultimately, the case highlights the legal challenges that can arise for open-source projects when dealing with proprietary software that is subject to intellectual property rights enforcement at any moment. BleepingComputer has asked for a comment from both Apple and Docker, but we have not received a response by publication.

        "text": "A former core infrastructure engineer at an industrial company headquartered in Somerset County, New Jersey, was arrested after locking Windows admins out of 254 servers in a failed extortion plot targeting his employer. According to court documents, company employees received a ransom email titled \"Your Network Has Been Penetrated\" on November 25, around 4:44 PM EST. The email claimed that all IT administrators had been locked out of their accounts and server backups had been deleted to make data recovery impossible. Additionally, the message threatened to shut down 40 random servers on the company's network daily over the next ten days unless a ransom of €700,000 (in the form of 20 Bitcoin) was paid—at the time, 20 BTC were worth $750,000. The investigation coordinated by FBI Special Agent James E. Dennehy in Newark uncovered that 57-year-old Daniel Rhyne from Kansas City, Missouri, who was working as a core infrastructure engineer for the New Jersey industrial company, had remotely accessed the company's computer systems without authorization using a company administrator account between November 9 and November 25. He then scheduled tasks on the company's domain controlled to change the passwords for the Administrator account, 13 domain administrator accounts, and 301 domain user accounts to the \"TheFr0zenCrew!\" text string. The criminal complaint alleges that Rhyne also scheduled tasks to change the passwords for two local administrator accounts, which would impact 254 servers, and for two more local admin accounts, which would affect 3,284 workstations on his employer's network. He also scheduled some tasks to shut down random servers and workstations over multiple days in December 2023. The investigators also found during forensic analysis that, while planning his extortion plot, Rhyne allegedly used a hidden virtual machine he accessed using his account and laptop to search the web on November 22 for information on how to delete domain accounts, clear Windows logs, and change domain user passwords using the command line. On November 15, Rhyne also made similar web searches on his laptop, including \"command line to change local administrator password\" and \"command line to remotely change local administrator password.\" \"By changing administrator and user passwords and shutting down Victim-l's servers, the scheduled tasks were collectively designed and intended to deny Victim-1 access to its systems and data,\" the criminal complaint reads. \"On or about November 25, 2023, at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST, network administrators employed at Victim-1 began receiving password reset notifications for a Victim-1 domain administrator account, as well as hundreds of Victim-1 user accounts. Shortly thereafter, the Victim-1 network administrators discovered that all other Victim-1 domain administrator accounts were deleted, thereby denying domain administrator access to Victim-1’s computer networks.\" Rhyne was arrested in Missouri on Tuesday, August 27, and was released after his initial appearance in the Kansas City federal court. The extortion, intentional computer damage, and wire fraud charges carry a maximum penalty of 35 years in prison and a $750,000 fine.

        "text": "Threat actors target Middle Eastern organizations with malware disguised as the legitimate Palo Alto GlobalProtect Tool that can steal data and execute remote PowerShell commands to infiltrate internal networks further. Palo Alto GlobalProtect is a legitimate security solution offered by Palo Alto Networks that provides secure VPN access with multi-factor authentication support. Organizations widely use the product to ensure remote employees, contractors, and partners can securely access private network resources. Using Palo Alto GlobalProtect as bait shows the attackers' targeting focuses on high-value corporate entities using enterprise software rather than random users. Researchers at Trend Micro who discovered this campaign have no insight into how the malware is delivered, but based on the lure used, they believe the attack starts with a phishing email. The victim executes a file named 'setup.exe' on their system, which deploys a file called 'GlobalProtect.exe' along with configuration files. At this stage, a window resembling a normal GlobalProtect installation process appears, but the malware quietly loads on the system in the background. Upon execution, it checks for signs of running on a sandbox before executing its primary code. Then, it transmits profiling information about the breached machine onto the command and control (C2) server. As an additional evasion layer, the malware uses AES encryption on its strings and data packets to be exfiltrated to the C2. The C2 address seen by Trend Micro used a newly registered URL containing the \"sharjahconnect\" string, making it appear like a legitimate VPN connection portal for Sharjah-based offices in the United Arab Emirates. Considering the campaign's targeting scope, this choice helps the threat actors blend with normal operations and reduce red flags that could raise the victim's suspicion. Beacons sent out at periodic intervals are employed to communicate the malware status with the threat actors in the post-infection phase using the Interactsh open-source tool. While Interactsh is a legitimate open-source tool commonly used by pentesters, its related domain, oast.fun, has also been observed in APT-level operations in the past, like in APT28 campaigns. However, no attribution was given in this operation using the Palo Alto product lure. The commands received from the command and control server are: Trend Micro notes that, while the attackers remain unknown, the operation appears highly targeted, using custom URLs for the targeted entities and freshly registered C2 domains to evade blocklists.

        "text": "​Since surfacing in February 2024, RansomHub ransomware affiliates have breached over 200 victims from a wide range of critical U.S. infrastructure sectors. This relatively new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation extorts victims in exchange for not leaking stolen files and sells the documents to the highest bidder if negotiations fail. The ransomware group focuses on data-theft-based extortion rather than encrypting victims' files, although they were also identified as potential buyers of Knight ransomware source code. Since the start of the year, RansomHub has claimed responsibility for breaching American not-for-profit credit union Patelco, the Rite Aid drugstore chain, the Christie's auction house, U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications, and oil services giant Halliburton. Frontier Communications later warned over 750,000 customers their personal information was exposed in a data breach. RansomHub's data leak site also leaked stolen Change Healthcare data after the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware operation shut down. A joint advisory released today by the FBI, CISA, the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also confirms that the threat actors target their victims in double-extortion attacks. The federal agencies said RansomHub (formerly known as Cyclops and Knight) \"has established itself as an efficient and successful service model (recently attracting high-profile affiliates from other prominent variants such as LockBit and ALPHV).\" \"Since its inception in February 2024, RansomHub has encrypted and exfiltrated data from at least 210 victims representing the water and wastewater, information technology, government services and facilities, healthcare and public health, emergency services, food and agriculture, financial services, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing, transportation, and communications critical infrastructure sectors,\" the advisory adds. The four authoring agencies advised network defenders to implement the recommendations in today's advisory to reduce the risk and impact of RansomHub ransomware attacks. They should focus on patching vulnerabilities already exploited in the wild and use strong passwords and multifactor authentication (MFA) for webmail, VPN, and accounts linked to critical systems. It's also recommended to keep software updated and conduct vulnerability assessments as a standard part of security protocols. The four agencies also provide RansomHub indicators of compromise (IOCs) and information on their affiliates' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) identified during FBI investigations as recently as August 2024. \"The authoring organizations do not encourage paying a ransom, as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered,\" the federal agencies added. \"Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.\" Update: Added Halliburton to the list of previous victims.

        "text": "GitHub is being abused to distribute the Lumma Stealer information-stealing malware as fake fixes posted in project comments. The campaign was first reported by a contributor to the teloxide rust library, who noted on Reddit that they received five different comments in their GitHub issues that pretended to be fixes but were instead pushing malware. Further review by BleepingComputer found thousands of similar comments posted to a wide range of projects on GitHub, all offering fake fixes to other people's questions. The solution tells people to download a password-protected archive from mediafire.com or through a bit.ly URL and run the executable within it. In the current campaign, the password has been \"changeme\" in all the comments we have seen. Reverse engineer Nicholas Sherlock told BleepingComputer that over 29,000 comments pushing this malware had been posted over a 3-day period. Clicking on the link brings visitors to a download page for a file called 'fix.zip,' which contains a few DLL files and an executable named x86_64-w64-ranlib.exe. Running the executable on Any.Run indicates it is the Lumma Stealer information-stealing malware. Lumma Stealer is an advanced info stealer that, when executed, attempts to steal cookies, credentials, passwords, credit cards, and browsing history from Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and other Chromium browsers. The malware can also steal cryptocurrency wallets, private keys, and text files with names like seed.txt, pass.txt, ledger.txt, trezor.txt, metamask.txt, bitcoin.txt, words, wallet.txt, *.txt, and *.pdf, as these are likely to contain private crypto keys and passwords. This data is collected into an archive and sent back to the attacker, where they can use the information in further attacks or sell it on cybercrime marketplaces. While GitHub Staff has been deleting these comments as they are detected, people have already reported falling for the attack. For those who ran the malware, you must change the passwords at all your accounts using a unique password for each site and migrate cryptocurrency to a new wallet. Last month, Check Point Research disclosed a similar campaign by the Stargazer Goblin threat actors, who created a malware Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) from over 3,000 fake accounts on GitHub to push information-stealing malware. It is unclear if this is the same campaign or a new one conducted by different threat actors.

        "text": "The RansomHub ransomware gang is behind the recent cyberattack on oil and gas services giant Halliburton, which disrupted the company's IT systems and business operations. The attack caused widespread disruption, and BleepingComputer was told that customers couldn't generate invoices or purchase orders because the required systems were down. Halliburton disclosed the attack last Friday in an SEC filing, stating they suffered a cyberattack on August 21, 2024, by an unauthorized party. \"On August 21, 2024, Halliburton Company (the \"Company\") became aware that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain of its systems,\" read Halliburton's SEC filing. \"When the Company learned of the issue, the Company activated its cybersecurity response plan and launched an investigation internally with the support of external advisors to assess and remediate the unauthorized activity.\" The company provides a numerous services to oil and gas companies, including well construction, drilling, hydraulic fracturing (fracking), and IT software and services. Due to the company's wide range of services, there is a great deal of connectivity between them and their customers. However, the company has not shared many details about the attack, with a customer in the oil and gas industry telling BleepingComputer that they have been left in the dark about determining if the attack impacted them and how to protect themselves. This has caused other customers to disconnect from Halliburton due to the lack of information being shared. BleepingComputer has also been told that some companies are working with ONG-ISAC—an agency that acts as a central point of coordination and communication for physical and cybersecurity threats against the oil and gas industry—to receive technical information about the attack to determine if they were breached as well. For days, there have been rumors that Halliburton suffered a RansomHub ransomware attack, with users claiming this on Reddit and on the job layoff discussion site, TheLayoff, where a partial RansomHub ransom note was published. When BleepingComputer contacted Halliburton about these claims, Halliburton said they were not making any further comments. \"We are not commenting beyond what was included in our filing. Any subsequent communications will be in the form of an 8-K,\" Halliburton told BleepingComputer. However, in an August 26 email sent to suppliers and shared with BleepingComputer, Halliburton provided additional information stating that the company took systems offline to protect them and is working with Mandiant to investigate the incident. \"We are reaching out to update you about a cybersecurity issue affecting Halliburton,\" reads the letter seen by BleepingComputer. \"As soon as we learned of the issue, we activated our cybersecurity response plan and took steps to address it, including (1) proactively taking certain systems offline to help protect them, (2) engaging the support of leading external advisors, including Mandiant, and (3) notifying law enforcement.\" They also stated that their email systems continue to operate as they’re hosted on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. A workaround is also available for transacting and issuing purchase orders. This email includes a list of IOCs containing file names and IP addresses associated with the attack that customers can use to detect similar activity on their network. One of these IOCs is for a Windows executable named maintenance.exe, which BleepingComputer has confirmed to be a RansomHub ransomware encryptor. After analyzing the sample, it appears to be a newer version than previously analyzed, as it contains a new \"-cmd string\" command-line argument, which will execute a command on the device before encrypting files. The RansomHub ransomware operation launched in February 2024, claiming it was a data theft extortion and extortion group that sold stolen files to the highest bidder. However, soon after, it was discovered that the operation also utilized ransomware encryptors in its double-extortion attacks, where the threat actors breached networks, stole data, and then encrypted files. The encrypted files and the threat to leak stolen data were then used as leverage to scare companies into paying a ransom. Symantec analyzed the ransomware encryptors and reported that they were based on the Knight ransomware encryptors, formerly known as Cyclops. The Knight operation claimed they sold their source code in February 2024 and shut down just as RansomHub launched. This has made many researchers believe that RansomHub is a rebrand of the Knight ransomware operation. Today, the FBI released an advisory about RansomHub, sharing the threat actor’s tactics and warning that they breached at least 210 victims since February. It is common for the FBI and CISA to publish coordinated advisories on threat actors soon after they conduct a highly impactful attack on critical infrastructure, such as Halliburton. However, it is not known if the advisory and the attack are linked. Since the start of the year, RansomHub has been responsible for numerous high-profile attacks, including those on American not-for-profit credit union Patelco, the Rite Aid drugstore chain, the Christie's auction house, and U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications. The ransomware operation's data leak site was also utilized to leak stolen data belonging to Change Healthcare following the shutdown of the BlackCat and ALPHV ransomware operation. It is believed that after BlackCat shut down, some of its affiliates moved to RansomHub, allowing them to quickly escalate their attacks with experienced ransomware threat actors.

        "text": "The Corona Mirai-based malware botnet is spreading through a 5-year-old remote code execution (RCE) zero-day in AVTECH IP cameras, which have been discontinued for years and will not receive a patch. The flaw, discovered by Akamai's Aline Eliovich, is tracked as CVE-2024-7029 and is a high-severity (CVSS v4 score: 8.7) issue in the \"brightness\" function of the cameras, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject commands over the network using specially crafted requests. Specifically, the easy-to-exploit flaw lies in the \"brightness\" argument in the \"action=\" parameter of the AVTECH cameras' firmware, intended to allow remote adjustments to the brightness of a camera. The flaw impacts all AVTECH AVM1203 IP cameras running on firmware versions up to Fullmg-1023-1007-1011-1009. Due to the impacted models no longer being supported by the Taiwanese vendor, having reached their end of life (EoL) in 2019, no patch is available to address CVE-2024-7029, and no fixes are expected to be released. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an advisory at the start of the month to warn about CVE-2024-7029 and the availability of public exploits, warning that the cameras are still used in commercial facilities, financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation systems. Proof of concept (PoC) exploits for the particular flaw have been available since at least 2019, but a CVE was only assigned this month, and no active exploitation had been observed previously. Corona is a Mirai-based variant that has been around since at least 2020, exploiting various vulnerabilities in IoT devices to propagate. Akamai's SIRT team reports that starting on March 18, 2024, Corona began leveraging CVE-2024-7029 in attacks in the wild, targeting AVM1203 cameras still in service despite them having reached EoL five years ago. The first active campaign we observed began on March 18, 2024, but analysis showed activity for this variant as early as December 2023. The proof of concept (PoC) for CVE-2024-7029 has been publicly available since at least February 2019, but it never had a proper CVE assignment until August 2024. The Corona attacks, as those have been captured in Akamai's honeypots, exploit CVE-2024-7029 to download and execute a JavaScript file, which, in turn, loads the primary botnet payload onto the device. Once nested on the device, the malware connects to its command and control (C2) servers and awaits instructions on executing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Other flaws targeted by Corona, according to Akamai's analysis, are: Users of AVTECH AVM1203 IP cameras are recommended to take them offline immediately and replace them with newer and actively supported models. As IP cameras are commonly exposed to the internet, making them attractive targets for threat actors, they should always run the latest firmware version to ensure known bugs are fixed. If a device becomes discontinued, it should be replaced with newer models to continue receiving security updates. Furthermore, default credentials should be changed to strong and unique passwords and they should be separated from critical or production networks.

        "text": "The APT33 Iranian hacking group has used new Tickler malware to backdoor the networks of organizations in the government, defense, satellite, oil and gas sectors in the United States and the United Arab Emirates. As Microsoft security researchers observed, the threat group (also tracked as Peach Sandstorm and Refined Kitten), which operates on behalf of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), used this new malware as part of an intelligence collection campaign between April and July 2024. Throughout these attacks, the threat actors leveraged Microsoft Azure infrastructure for command-and-control (C2), using fraudulent, attacker-controlled Azure subscriptions that the company has since disrupted. APT33 breached targeted organizations in the defense, space, education, and government sectors following successful password spray attacks between April and May 2024. In these attacks, they attempted to gain access to many accounts using a small number of commonly used passwords to avoid triggering account lockouts. \"While the password spray activity appeared consistently across sectors, Microsoft observed Peach Sandstorm exclusively leveraging compromised user accounts in the education sector to procure operational infrastructure. In these cases, the threat actor accessed existing Azure subscriptions or created one using the compromised account to host their infrastructure,\" Microsoft said. The Azure infrastructure they gained control of was used in subsequent operations targeting the government, defense, and space sectors. \"In the past year, Peach Sandstorm has successfully compromised several organizations, primarily in the aforementioned sectors, using bespoke tooling,\" Microsoft added. The Iranian threat group also used this tactic in November 2023 to compromise the networks of defense contractors worldwide and deploy FalseFont backdoor malware. In September, Microsoft warned of another APT33 campaign that had targeted thousands of organizations worldwide in extensive password spray attacks since February 2023, leading to breaches in the defense, satellite, and pharmaceutical sectors. Microsoft has announced that starting October 15, multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be mandatory for all Azure sign-in attempts to protect Azure accounts against phishing and hijacking attempts. The company has previously found that MFA allows 99.99% of MFA-enabled accounts to resist hacking attempts and reduces the risk of compromise by 98.56%, even when attackers attempt to breach accounts using previously compromised credentials.

        "text": "A new malware campaign is spreading a previously undocumented backdoor named \"Voldemort\" to organizations worldwide, impersonating tax agencies from the U.S., Europe, and Asia. As per a Proofpoint report, the campaign started on August 5, 2024, and has disseminated over 20,000 emails to over 70 targeted organizations, reaching 6,000 in a single day at the peak of its activity. Over half of all targeted organizations are in the insurance, aerospace, transportation, and education sectors. The threat actor behind this campaign is unknown, but Proofpoint believes the most likely objective is to conduct cyber espionage. The attack is similar to what Proofpoint described at the start of the month but involved a different malware set in the final stage. A new Proofpoint report says the attackers are crafting phishing emails to match a targeted organization's location based on public information. The phishing emails impersonate taxing authorities from the organization's country, stating that there is updated tax information and includes links to associated documents. Clicking on the link brings recipients to a landing page hosted on InfinityFree, which uses Google AMP Cache URLs to redirect the victim to a page with a \"Click to view document\" button. When the button is clicked, the page will check the browser's User Agent, and if it's for Windows, redirect the target to a search-ms URI (Windows Search Protocol) that points to a TryCloudflare-tunneled URI. Non-Windows users are redirected to an empty Google Drive URL that serves no malicious content. If the victim interacts with the search-ms file, Windows Explorer is triggered to display a LNK or ZIP file disguised as a PDF. The use of the search-ms: URI has become popular lately with phishing campaigns as even though this file is hosted on an external WebDAV/SMB share, it is made to appear as if it resides locally in the Downloads folder to trick the victim into opening it. Doing so executes a Python script from another WebDAV share without downloading it on the host, which performs system info collection to profile the victim. At the same time, a decoy PDF is displayed to obscure the malicious activity. The script also downloads a legitimate Cisco WebEx executable (CiscoCollabHost.exe) and a malicious DLL (CiscoSparkLauncher.dll) to load Voldemort using DLL side-loading. Voldemort is a C-based backdoor that supports a wide range of commands and file management actions, including exfiltration, introducing new payloads into the system, and file deletion. The list of supported commands is given below: A notable feature of Voldemort is that it uses Google Sheets as a command and control server (C2), pinging it to get new commands to execute on the infected device and as a repository for stolen data. Each infected machine writes its data to specific cells within the Google Sheet, which can be designated by unique identifiers like UUIDs, ensuring isolation and clearer management of the breached systems. Voldemort uses Google's API with an embedded client ID, secret, and refresh token to interact with Google Sheets, which are stored in its encrypted configuration. This approach provides the malware with a reliable and highly available C2 channel, and also reduces the likelihood of network communication being flagged by security tools. As Google Sheets is commonly used in the enterprise, it also makes blocking the service impractical. In 2023, the Chinese APT41 hacking group was previously seen using Google Sheets as a command and control server through the use of the red-teaming GC2 toolkit. To defend against this campaign, Proofpoint recommends limiting access to external file-sharing services to trusted servers, blocking connections to TryCloudflare if not actively needed, and monitoring for suspicious PowerShell execution.

        "text": "North Korean hackers have exploited a recently patched Google Chrome zero-day (CVE-2024-7971) to deploy the FudModule rootkit after gaining SYSTEM privileges using a Windows Kernel exploit. \"We assess with high confidence that the observed exploitation of CVE-2024-7971 can be attributed to a North Korean threat actor targeting the cryptocurrency sector for financial gain,\" Microsoft said on Friday, attributing the attacks to Citrine Sleet (previously tracked as DEV-0139). Other cybersecurity vendors track this North Korean threat group as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, and UNC4736, while the U.S. government collectively refers to malicious actors sponsored by the North Korean government as Hidden Cobra. Citrine Sleet targets financial institutions, focusing on cryptocurrency organizations and associated individuals, and has been previously linked to Bureau 121 of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. The North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites camouflaged as legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect potential victims with fake job applications or weaponized cryptocurrency wallets or trading apps. UNC4736 trojanized the Electron-based desktop client of video conferencing software maker 3CX in March 2023, following a previous supply-chain attack in which they breached the site of Trading Technologies, a stock trading automation company, to push trojanized X_TRADER software builds. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also linked AppleJeus to the compromise of Trading Technologies' website in a March 2022 report. The U.S. government also warned about North Korean-backed state hackers targeting cryptocurrency-related companies and individuals with AppleJeus malware for years. Google patched the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day last week, describing it as a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. This vulnerability enabled the threat actors to gain remote code execution in the sandboxed Chromium renderer process of targets redirected to an attacker-controlled website at voyagorclub[.]space. After escaping the sandbox, they used the compromised web browser to download a Windows sandbox escape exploit targeting the CVE-2024-38106 flaw in the Windows Kernel (fixed during this month's Patch Tuesday), which enabled them to gain SYSTEM privileges. The threat actors also downloaded and loaded the FudModule rootkit into memory, which was used for kernel tampering and direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) and allowed them to bypass kernel security mechanisms. Since its discovery in October 2022, this rootkit has also been used by Diamond Sleet, another North Korean hacking group with which Citrine Sleet shares other malicious tools and attack infrastructure. \"On August 13, Microsoft released a security update to address a zero-day vulnerability in the AFD.sys driver in Windows (CVE-2024-38193) identified by Gen Threat Labs,\" Microsoft said on Friday. \"In early June, Gen Threat Labs identified Diamond Sleet exploiting this vulnerability in an attack employing the FudModule rootkit, which establishes full standard user-to-kernel access, advancing from the previously seen admin-to-kernel access.\" Redmond added that one of the organizations targeted in attacks exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 Chrome zero-day was also previously targeted by another North Korean threat group tracked as BlueNoroff (or Sapphire Sleet). Russian APT29 hackers use iOS, Chrome exploits created by spyware vendors Google tags a tenth Chrome zero-day as exploited this year Google fixes ninth Chrome zero-day tagged as exploited this year South Korean hackers exploited WPS Office zero-day to deploy malware Google increases Chrome bug bounty rewards up to $250,000",

        "text": "The malicious PoorTry kernel-mode Windows driver used by multiple ransomware gangs to turn off Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions has evolved into an EDR wiper, deleting files crucial for the operation of security solutions and making restoration harder. Though Trend Micro had warned about this functionality added on Poortry since May 2023, Sophos has now confirmed seeing the EDR wiping attacks in the wild. This evolution of PoorTry from an EDR deactivator to an EDR wiper represents a very aggressive shift in tactics by ransomware actors, who now prioritize a more disruptive setup phase to ensure better outcomes in the encryption stage. PoorTry, also known as 'BurntCigar,' was developed in 2021 as a kernel-mode driver to disable EDR and other security software. The kit, used by several ransomware gangs, including BlackCat, Cuba, and LockBit, first gained attention when its developers found ways to get their malicious drivers signed through Microsoft's attestation signing process. Other cybercrime groups, such as Scattered Spider, were also seen utilizing the tool in breaches focused on credential theft and SIM-swapping attacks. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Poortry continued to evolve, optimizing its code and using obfuscation tools like VMProtect, Themida, and ASMGuard to pack the driver and its loader (Stonestop) for evasion. The latest report by Sophos is based on a RansomHub attack in July 2024 that employed Poortry to delete critical executable files (EXEs), dynamic link libraries (DLLs), and other essential components of security software. This ensures that EDR software cannot be recovered or restarted by defenders, leaving the system completely unprotected in the following encryption phase of the attack. The process starts with the user-mode component of PoorTry, identifying the security software's installation directories and the critical files within those directories. It then sends requests to the kernel-mode component to systematically terminate security-related processes and then delete their crucial files. Paths to those files are hardcoded onto PoorTry, while the user-mode component supports deletion either by file name or type, giving it some operational flexibility to cover a broader range of EDR products. The malware can be fine-tuned only to delete files crucial to the EDR's operation, avoiding unnecessary noise in the risky first phases of the attack. Sophos also notes that the latest Poortry variants employ signature timestamp manipulation to bypass security checks on Windows and use the metadata from other software like Internet Download Manager by Tonec Inc. The attackers were seen employing a tactic known as \"certificate roullete,\" where they deploy multiple variants of the same payload signed with different certificates to increase their chances that at least one will execute successfully. Despite efforts to track PoorTry's evolution and stop its effectiveness, the developers of the tool have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new defense measures. The EDR wiping functionality gives the tool an edge over defenders responding to attacks but could also provide new opportunities for detecting the attacks in the pre-encryption phase.

        "text": "The City of Columbus, Ohio, has filed a lawsuit against security researcher David Leroy Ross, aka Connor Goodwolf, accusing him of illegally downloading and disseminating data stolen from the City's IT network and leaked by the Rhysida ransomware gang. Columbus, the capital and most populous (2,140,000) city in Ohio, suffered a ransomware attack on July 18, 2024, which caused various service outages and unavailability of email and IT connectivity between public agencies. At the end of July, the City's administration announced that no systems had been encrypted, but they were looking into the possibility that sensitive data might have been stolen in the attack. On the same day, Rhysida ransomware claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging they stole 6.5 TB of databases, including employee credentials, server dumps, city video camera feeds, and other sensitive information. On August 8, after failing to extort the City, the threat actors published 45% of stolen data comprising 260,000 files (3.1 TB), exposing much of what they previously claimed to be holding. According to the City's complaint, the exposed dataset includes two backup databases containing large amounts of data gathered by the local prosecutors and police force, dating back to at least 2015, containing, among other things, the personal information of undercover officers. On the day of the data leak on Rhysida's extortion portal on the dark web, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther stated on local media that the disclosed information was neither valuable nor usable and that the attack had been successfully thwarted. A few hours later, Goodwolf disputed the Mayor's claim that no sensitive or valuable data was exposed by sharing information with the media about what the leaked dataset included. In response to this, on August 12, Mayor Ginther claimed that the exposed data was \"encrypted or corrupted,\" so the leak is unusable and should be of no concern to the public. However, Goodwolf disputed these claims, sharing samples of the data with the media to illustrate that it contained unencrypted personal data of people in Columbus. \"Among the details laid bare were names from domestic violence cases, and Social Security numbers for police officers and crime victims alike. The dump not only impacts city employees, but also revealed personal information for residents and visitors going back years,\" reported NBC4. The lawsuit submitted by Columbus alleges that Goodwolf's conduct of spreading stolen data was both negligent and illegal, resulting in great concern in the community. Moreover, the City alleges that the leaked data isn't accessible to anybody, as Goodwolf stated, as it was published on a platform of limited access, requiring knowledge to locate. \"Defendant's actions of downloading from the dark web and spreading this stolen, sensitive information at a local level has resulted in widespread concern throughout the Central Ohio region,\" reads the complaint. \"Only individuals willing to navigate and interact with the criminal element on the dark web, who also have the computer expertise and tools necessary to download data from the dark web, would be able to do so.\" The complaint notes that Goodwolf's sharing of law enforcement data and the alleged plans to create a website for people to see if their data was exposed interferes with police investigations. The City seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction against Goodwolf to prevent further dissemination of stolen data. Additionally, the City is seeking damages exceeding $25,000. A reported by NBC4, a Franklin County judge issued the temporary restraining order yesterday, barring Goodwolf from accessing, downloading, and disseminating the City's stolen data. The order also requires the defendant to preserve all data that was downloaded to date. In a press conference about the lawsuit, shown below, City Attorney Zach Klein says that the lawsuit is not about suppressing free speech, as Goodwolf can still talk about the leak, but is aimed at preventing him from downloading and disseminating the stolen information.

        "text": "Security researchers have found a vulnerability in a key air transport security system that allowed unauthorized individuals to potentially bypass airport security screenings and gain access to aircraft cockpits. Researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered the vulnerability in FlyCASS, a third-party web-based service that some airlines use to manage the Known Crewmember (KCM) program and the Cockpit Access Security System (CASS). KCM is a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) initiative that allows pilots and flight attendants to skip security screening, and CASS enables authorized pilots to use jumpseats in cockpits when traveling. The KCM system, operated by ARINC (a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace), verifies airline employees' credentials through an online platform. The process involves scanning a KCM barcode or entering an employee number, then cross-checking with the airline's database to grant access without requiring a security screening. Similarly, the CASS system verifies pilots for cockpit jumpseat access when they need to commute or travel. The researchers discovered that FlyCASS's login system was susceptible to SQL injection, a vulnerability that enables attackers to insert SQL statements for malicious database queries. By exploiting this flaw, they could log in as an administrator for a participating airline, Air Transport International, and manipulate employee data within the system. They added a fictitious employee, \"Test TestOnly,\" and granted this account access to KCM and CASS, which effectively allowed them to \"skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners.\" \"Anyone with basic knowledge of SQL injection could login to this site and add anyone they wanted to KCM and CASS, allowing themselves to both skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners,\" Carroll said. ​Realizing the severity of the issue, the researchers immediately began a disclosure process, contacting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on April 23, 2024. The researchers decided not to contact the FlyCASS site directly as it appeared to be run by a single person and were afraid the disclosure would alarm them. The DHS responded, acknowledging the seriousness of the vulnerability, and confirmed that FlyCASS was disconnected from the KCM/CASS system on May 7, 2024, as a precautionary measure. Soon after, the vulnerability was fixed on FyCASS. However, efforts to further coordinate a safe disclosure of the vulnerability were met with resistance after the DHS stopped responding to their emails. The TSA press office also sent the researchers a statement denying the vulnerability's impact, claiming that the system's vetting process would prevent unauthorized access. After being informed by the researchers, the TSA also quietly removed information from its website that contradicted its statements. \"After we informed the TSA of this, they deleted the section of their website that mentions manually entering an employee ID, and did not respond to our correction. We have confirmed that the interface used by TSOs still allows manual input of employee IDs,\" Carroll said. Carroll also said that the flaw could have allowed for more extensive security breaches, such as altering existing KCM member profiles to bypass any vetting processes for new members. After the researchers' report was released, another researcher named Alesandro Ortiz discovered that FlyCASS appeared to have suffered a MedusaLocker ransomware attack in February 2024, with a Joe Sandbox analysis showing encrypted files and a ransom note. ​\"In April, TSA became aware of a report that a vulnerability in a third party's database containing airline crewmember information was discovered and that through testing of the vulnerability, an unverified name was added to a list of crewmembers in the database. No government data or systems were compromised and there are no transportation security impacts related to the activities,\" TSA press secretary R. Carter Langston told BleepingComputer. \"TSA does not solely rely on this database to verify the identity of crewmembers. TSA has procedures in place to verify the identity of crewmembers and only verified crewmembers are permitted access to the secure area in airports. TSA worked with stakeholders to mitigate against any ​identified cyber vulnerabilities.\" BleepingComputer also contacted the DHS earlier today, but a spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

        "text": "The Russian state-sponsored APT29 hacking group has been observed using the same iOS and Android exploits created by commercial spyware vendors in a series of cyberattacks between November 2023 and July 2024. The activity was discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), who said the n-day flaws have already been patched but remain effective on devices that have not been updated. APT29, also known as \"Midnight Blizzard\", targeted multiple websites of the Mongolian government and employed \"watering hole\" tactics. A watering hole is a cyberattack where a legitimate site is compromised with malicious code designed to deliver payloads to visitors that meet specific criteria, like device architecture or location (IP-based). Interestingly, TAG notes that APT29 used exploits that were almost identical to those used by commercial surveillance-ware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa, who created and leveraged the flaws as zero days when no fix was available. Google's threat analysts note that APT29 has a long history of exploiting zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities. In 2021, the Russian cyber-operatives exploited CVE-2021-1879 as a zero-day, targeting government officials in Eastern Europe, attempting to deliver a cookie-stealing framework that snatched LinkedIn, Gmail, and Facebook accounts. In November 2023, APT29 compromised Mongolian government sites 'mfa.gov[.]mn' and 'cabinet.gov[.]mn' to add a malicious iframe that delivered an exploit for CVE-2023-41993. This is an iOS WebKit flaw that APT29 leveraged for stealing browser cookies from iPhone users running iOS 16.6.1 and older. TAG reports that this exploit was exactly the same as the one Intellexa used in September 2023, leveraging CVE-2023-41993 as a zero-day vulnerability at the time. In February 2024, APT29 compromised another Mongolian government website, 'mga.gov[.]mn,' to inject a new iframe delivering the same exploit. On July 2024, APT leveraged exploits for CVE-2024-5274 and CVE-2024-4671, impacting Google Chrome, to attack Android users visiting 'mga.gov[.]mn'. The purpose was to steal cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data stored on the victims' Chrome browser. The exploit used for CVE-2024-5274 is a slightly modified version of that NSO Group used for zero-day exploitation in May 2024, while the exploit for CVE-2024-4671 featured many similarities to Intellexa's previous exploits. It is unknown how the APT29 hackers gained access to the exploits previously known only to NSO Group and Intellexa. However, independently creating their own exploits with the limited information seems unlikely. Possible explanations include APT29 hacking spyware vendors, recruiting or bribing rogue insiders working at those firms or maintaining a collaboration either directly or via an intermediary. Another possibility is their purchase from a vulnerability broker who previously sold them to surveillance companies as zero-days. No matter how these exploits reach sophisticated state-backed threat groups, the key issue is that they do. This makes it even more critical to promptly address zero-day vulnerabilities labeled as 'under limited scope exploitation' in advisories—far more urgent than mainstream users might realize. North Korean hackers exploit Chrome zero-day to deploy rootkit Google tags a tenth Chrome zero-day as exploited this year Hackers steal banking creds from iOS, Android users via PWA apps Google fixes ninth Chrome zero-day tagged as exploited this year Google fixes Android kernel zero-day exploited in targeted attacks",

        "text": "The South Korea-aligned cyberespionage group APT-C-60 has been leveraging a zero-day code execution vulnerability in the Windows version of WPS Office to install the SpyGlace backdoor on East Asian targets. WPS Office is a productivity suite developed by the Chinese firm Kingsoft that is popular in Asia. Reportedly, it has over 500 million active users worldwide. The zero-day flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-7262, has been leveraged in attacks in the wild since at least late February 2024, but impacts versions from 12.2.0.13110 (August 2023) to 12.1.0.16412 (March 2024). Kingsoft \"silently\" patched the problem in March this year without informing the customers that the flaw was actively exploited, prompting ESET, who discovered the campaign and vulnerability, to publish a detailed report today. In addition to CVE-2024-7262, ESET's investigation unveiled a second severe flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-7263, which Kingsoft patched in late May 2024 with version 12.2.0.17119. CVE-2024-7262 resides in how the software handles custom protocol handlers, specifically 'ksoqing://,' which allows the execution of external applications through specially crafted URLs within documents. Due to improper validation and sanitization of these URLs, the flaw allows attackers to craft malicious hyperlinks that lead to arbitrary code execution. APT-C-60 created spreadsheet documents (MHTML files) where they embedded malicious hyperlinks hidden under a decoy image to trick the victim into clicking them, triggering the exploit. The processed URL parameters include a base64-encoded command to execute a specific plugin (promecefpluginhost.exe) that attempts to load a malicious DLL (ksojscore.dll) containing the attacker's code. This DLL is APT-C-60's downloader component, designed for fetching the final payload (TaskControler.dll) from the attacker's server, a custom backdoor named 'SpyGlace.' SpyGlace is a backdoor previously analyzed by Threatbook when APT-C-60 used it in attacks on human resources and trade-related organizations. While investigating APT-C-60's attacks, ESET's researchers discovered CVE-2024-7263, a second arbitrary code execution flaw impacting WPS Office, which emerged as an incomplete patch of CVE-2024-7262. Specifically, Kingsoft's initial attempt to address the problem added validation on specific parameters. However, some, like the 'CefPluginPathU8,' were still not adequately secured, allowing attackers to point to paths of malicious DLLs through promecefpluginhost.exe again. ESET explains that this vulnerability can be exploited locally or through a network share, where the malicious DLL could be hosted. Despite this possibility, the researchers did not observe APT-C-60 or any other actors leveraging the flaw in the wild. However, given enough time, it's not unlikely they would have discovered the security gap left by Kingsoft's bad patch. Users of WPS Office are recommended to move to the latest release as soon as possible, or at least 12.2.0.17119, to address both code execution flaws. \"The exploit is cunning as it is deceptive enough to trick any user into clicking on a legitimate-looking spreadsheet while also being very effective and reliable,\" warns ESET in the report. \"The choice of the MHTML file format allowed the attackers to turn a code execution vulnerability into a remote one.\" Check this GitHub repository for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with the APT-C-60 activity.

        "text": "Fake trading apps on Google Play and Apple's App Store lure victims into “pig butchering” scams that have a global reach. The apps have been removed from the official Android and iOS stores after accumulating several thousand downloads, say researcher at cybersecurity company Group-IB, who discovered the fraud. Pig butchering is the name of a scam where the victim is led to believe they are getting high investment returns on a fake trading platform that displays fabricated information. Fraudsters use social engineering to keep the victim depositing funds and prevent them from withdrawing the displayed \"profit.\" The scam is revealed when the victim attempts to cash their money, which the fraudsters have already moved to their accounts. The fraudulent apps, which Group-IB categorizes under the “UniShadowTrade” malware family, are built using the UniApp framework and were first spotted in May. Their names are SBI-INT (iOS), Finans Insights (Android), Finans Trader6 (Android) and a look at the download counter for the last two shows that they were downloaded 5,000 times. Group-IB also warns that the UniShadow Trade apps can mimick a variety of legitimate cryptocurrency and trading platforms, providing the following extensive list with potential names that could be used in impersonation attempts. The researchers report that the apps were disguised as tools for \"algebraic mathematical formulas and 3D graphics volume area calculations\" on iOS, and as financial news feed aggregators on Android However, after installation they redirected victims to fake trading platforms accessible only via invitation codes. According to the researchers, the fraudsters groomed their victims in conversations over dating apps and used social engineering to gain their trust. The apps requested that users uploaded several documents, such as national IDs and passports, both to add legitimacy to the investment process and also to further empower the threat actors with sensitive information theft. After the removal of the fraudulent apps from the app stores in June, the threat actors moved the distribution operation to phishing websites, showing no signs of stopping. To stay clear from fraudulent investment schemes, it is recommended to do some research before deciding to work with an investment platform, such as checking the background and history (financial records, past performance, reputation), or if it is regulated by a locally or globally-recognized authority. Users should at least be wary of unsolicited messages and URLs promising high investment returns, since scams are typically promoted this way.

        "text": "The Browser Company has introduced an Arc Bug Bounty Program to encourage security researchers to report vulnerabilities to the project and receive rewards. This development comes in response to a critical remote code execution flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-45489, that could have enabled threat actors to launch mass-scale attacks against users of the program. The flaw allowed attackers to exploit how Arc uses Firebase for authentication and database management to execute arbitrary code on a target's browser. A researcher found what they describe as a \"catastrophic\" flaw in the \"Boosts\" (user-created customizations) feature that allows users to use JavaScript to modify a website when it is visited. The researcher found that they could cause malicious JavaScript code to run in other users' browsers simply by changing a Boosts' creator ID to another person's ID. When that Arc Browser user visited the site, it would launch the malicious code created by an attacker. Although the flaw was present on the browser for quite a while, it was promptly addressed on August 26, 2024, a day after the researcher responsibly disclosed it to the Arc team, for which they were awarded $2,000. The bug bounty program announced by the Browser Company covers Arc on macOS and Windows and Arc Search on the iOS platform. The set payouts can be summarized in the following four main categories, depending on the severity of the discovered flaws: More details about Arc's Bounty Program are available here. Regarding CVE-2024-45489, the Arc team notes in its latest announcement that auto-syncing of Boosts with JavaScript has been disabled, and a toggle to turn off all Boost-related features has been added on Arc 1.61.2, the latest version released on September 26. Also, an audit conducted by an external auditing expert is underway and will cover Arc's backed systems. A new MDM configuration option to disable Boosts for entire organizations will be released in the coming weeks. The Browser Company says new coding guidelines with an elevated focus on auditing and reviewing are now crafted, its incident response process is being revamped for better effectiveness, and new security team members will be welcomed aboard soon. Launched a little over a year ago, Arc quickly gained popularity thanks to its innovative user interface design, customization options, uBlock Origin integration, and speedy performance. Threat actors even used the browser's popularity to push malware to Windows users.

        "text": "U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA is warning about two critical vulnerabilities that allow authentication bypass and remote code execution in Optigo Networks ONS-S8 Aggregation Switch products used in critical infrastructure. The flaws concern weak authentication problems, allowing bypassing of password requirements, and user input validation issues potentially leading to remote code execution, arbitrary file uploads, and directory traversal. The device is used in critical infrastructure and manufacturing units worldwide, and considering that the flaws are remotely exploitable with low attack complexity, the risk is deemed very high. Currently, no fixes are available, so users are recommended to apply suggested mitigations proposed by the Canadian vendor. The first flaw is tracked as CVE-2024-41925 and is classified as a PHP Remote File Inclusion (RFI) problem stemming from incorrect validation or sanitation of user-supplied file paths. An attacker could use this vulnerability to perform directory traversal, bypass authentication, and execute arbitrary remote code. The second issue, tracked as CVE-2024-45367, is a weak authentication problem arising from improper password verification enforcement on the authentication mechanism. Exploiting this enables an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the switches' management interface, alter configurations, access sensitive data, or pivot to other network points. Both problems were discovered by Claroty Team82 and are rated as critical, with a CVSS v4 score of 9.3. The vulnerabilities impact all ONS-S8 Spectra Aggregation Switch versions up to and including 1.3.7. While CISA has not seen signs of these flaws being actively exploited, system administrators are recommended to perform the following actions to mitigate the flaws: CISA recommends that organizations observing suspicious activity on these devices follow their breach protocols and report the incident to the cybersecurity agency so that it can be tracked and correlated with other incidents.

        "text": "During a distributed denial-of-service campaign targeting organizations in the financial services, internet, and telecommunications sectors, volumetric attacks peaked at 3.8 terabits per second, the largest publicly recorded to date. The assault consisted of a “month-long” barrage of more than 100 hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks flooding the network infrastructure with garbage data. In a volumetric DDoS attack, the target is overwhelmed with large amounts of data to the point that they consume the bandwidth or exhaust the resources of applications and devices, leaving legitimate users with no access. Many of the attacks aimed at the target’s network infrastructure (network and transport layers L3/4) exceeded two billion packets per second (pps) and three terabits per second (Tbps). According to researchers at internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, the infected devices were spread across the globe but many of them were located in Russia, Vietnam, the U.S., Brazil, and Spain. The threat actor behind the campaign leveraged multiple types of compromised devices, which included a large number of Asus home routers, Mikrotik systems, DVRs, and web servers. Cloudflare mitigated all the DDoS attacks autonomously and noted that the one peaking at 3.8 Tbps lasted 65 seconds. The researchers say that the network of malicious devices used mainly the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on a fixed port, a protocol with fast data transfers but which does not require establishing a formal connection. Previously, Microsoft held the record for defending against the largest volumetric DDoS attack of 3.47 Tbps, which targeted an Azure customer in Asia. Typically, threat actors launching DDoS attacks rely on large networks of infected devices (botnets) or look for ways to amplify the delivered data at the target, which requires a smaller number of systems. In a report this week, cloud computing company Akamai confirmed that the recently disclosed CUPS vulnerabilities in Linux could be a viable vector for DDoS attacks. After scanning the public internet for systems vulnerable to CUPS, Akamai found that more than 58,000 were exposed to DDoS attacks from exploiting the Linux security issue. More testing revealed that hundreds of vulnerable “CUPS servers will beacon back repeatedly after receiving the initial requests, with some of them appearing to do it endlessly in response to HTTP/404 responses.” These servers sent thousands of requests to Akamai’s testing systems, showing significant potential for amplification from exploiting the CUPS flaws. Recently patched CUPS flaw can be used to amplify DDoS attacks CUPS flaws enable Linux remote code execution, but there’s a catch Cloudflare outage cuts off access to websites in some regions SonicWall warns of critical access control flaw in SonicOS",

        "text": "Comcast Cable Communications and Truist Bank have disclosed they were impacted by a data breach at FBCS, and are now informing their respective customers that their data has been compromised. The case concerns a data breach at Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collection agency in the U.S. that partners with various companies to collect unpaid debts on their behalf. Last April this year, FBCS informed of a data breach determined to have occurred between February 14 and February 26, 2024, when threat actors breached its network and stole the following details from its electronic records: The data breach was initially believed to have impacted 1.9 million people, but subsequent findings upped the tally to 3.2 million in June and, finally, 4.2 million individuals in July. The internal investigation into the incident appears to be ongoing, as FBCS recently informed additional entities that they had been impacted, including Comcast and Truist. Also, it is now made known that due to FBCS's worsening financial position, presumably a direct result of the breach, entities indirectly impacted by the incident will have to undertake the notification and remediation processes themselves. Comcast says FBCS assured them in March that the security incident impacted no customer data. However, on July 17, FBCS notified Comcast that its customer data was also impacted. According to a notice submitted to the Maine authorities, 273,703 Comcast customers were impacted by the breach. \"FBCS's investigation discovered that files downloaded by the unauthorized party included your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, and your Comcast account number and ID numbers used internally at FBCS,\" reads the notification sent to impacted customers. \"FBCS states that it has no indication that any personal information compromised during this incident has been further misused.\" Impacted people were given 12 months of free-of-charge identity theft protection services, with activation instructions enclosed. In related news, Truist Bank, one of the largest banks in the United States, also sent notices of a data breach to its customers linked to the FBCS incident. The letters were sent out in mid-September, but a sample was submitted more recently to the Californian authorities. \"FBCS has indicated that the type of information that may have been impacted varies per person and may include consumer name, address, account number, date of birth and Social Security number,\" disclosed Truist Bank. Truist operates over 2,700 branches across 15 states and employs 40,000 people. As such, the number of impacted people could be significant, though it has not been specified. BleepingComputer emailed Truist to learn how many of its customers were impacted by this incident, but a comment wasn't immediately available. Meanwhile, last June, Truist Bank confirmed a separate breach that reportedly occurred in October 2023 after a threat actor leaked stolen data on a hacking forum.

        "text": "A critical vulnerability in NVIDIA Container Toolkit impacts all AI applications in a cloud or on-premise environment that rely on it to access GPU resources. The security issue is tracked as CVE-2024-0132 and allows an adversary to perform container escape attacks and gain full access to the host system, where they could execute commands or exfiltrate sensitive information. The particular library comes pre-installed in many AI-focused platforms and virtual machine images and is the standard tool for GPU access when NVIDIA hardware is involved. According to Wiz Research, more than 35% of cloud environments are at risk of attacks exploiting the vulnerability. The security issue CVE-2024-0132 received a critical-severity score of 9.0. It is a container escape problem that affects NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.16.1 and earlier, and GPU Operator 24.6.1 and older. The problem is a lack of secure isolation of the containerized GPU from the host, allowing containers to mount sensitive parts of the host filesystem or access runtime resources like Unix sockets for inter-process communication. While most filesystems are mounted with “read-only” permissions, certain Unix sockets such as ‘docker.sock’ and ‘containerd.sock’ remain writable, allowing direct interactions with the host, including command execution. An attacker can take advantage of this omission via a specially crafted container image and reach the host when executed. Wiz says that such an attack could be carried out either directly, via shared GPU resources, or indirectly, when the target runs an image downloaded from a bad source. Wiz researchers discovered the vulnerability and reported it to NVIDIA on September 1st. The GPU maker acknowledged the report a couple of days later, and released a fix on September 26th. Impacted users are recommended to upgrade to NVIDIA Container Toolkit version 1.16.2 and NVIDIA GPU Operator 24.6.2. Technical details for the exploiting the security issue remain private for now, to give impacted organizations time to mitigate the issue in their environments. However, the researchers are planning to release more technical information.

Ivanti EPM is an all-in-one endpoint management solution that helps admins manage client devices on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and IoT operating systems. Tracked as CVE-2024-29824, this SQL Injection vulnerability in Ivanti EPM's Core server that unauthenticated attackers within the same network can exploit to execute arbitrary code on unpatched systems. Ivanti released security updates to patch this security flaw in May, when it also addressed five other remote code execution bugs in EPM's Core server, all impacting Ivanti EPM 2022 SU5 and prior. Horizon3.ai security researchers published a CVE-2024-29824 deep dive in June and released a proof-of-concept exploit on GitHub that can be used to \"blindly execute commands on vulnerable Ivanti EPM appliances.\" They also advised admins looking for signs of potential exploitation on their appliances to review MS SQL logs for evidence of xp_cmdshell being used to obtain command execution. Today, Ivanti updated the original security advisory to state that it \"has confirmed exploitation of CVE-2024-29824 in the wild.\" \"At the time of this update, we are aware of a limited number of customers who have been exploited,\" the company added. On Tuesday, CISA followed suit and added the Ivanti EPM RCE flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, tagging it as actively exploited. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies now must secure vulnerable appliances within three weeks by October 23, as required by Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01) requires, While CISA's KEV catalog is primarily designed to alert federal agencies of vulnerabilities they should patch as soon as possible, organizations worldwide should also prioritize patching this vulnerability to block ongoing attacks. Multiple Ivanti vulnerabilities have been exploited as zero-day flaws in widespread attacks in recent months, targeting the company's VPN appliances and ICS, IPS, and ZTA gateways. Last month, Ivanti warned that threat actors were chaining two recently fixed Cloud Services Appliance (CSA) vulnerabilities to attack unpatched appliances. In response, Ivanti announced in September that it's working to improve its responsible disclosure process and testing capabilities to address such security threats more quickly. Ivanti partners with over 7,000 organizations to deliver system and IT asset management solutions to more than 40,000 companies globally.

        "text": "Hackers are actively exploiting a recently disclosed RCE vulnerability in Zimbra email servers that can be triggered simply by sending specially crafted emails to the SMTP server. The Zimbra remote code execution flaw is tracked as CVE-2024-45519 and exists in Zimbra's postjournal service, which is used to parse incoming emails over SMTP. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted emails with commands to execute in the CC field, which are then executed when the postjournal service processes the email. The malicious activity was first reported by HarfangLab's threat researcher Ivan Kwiatkowski, who characterized it as \"mass-exploitation,\" and was subsequently also confirmed by experts at Proofpoint. Proofpoint says they detected the malicious activity on September 28, one day after researchers at Project Discovery released a proof-of-concept exploit. The researchers warn that the attackers are sending emails that spoof Gmail and contain fake email addresses and malicious code in the email's \"CC\" field. If created properly, the Zimbra email server will parse the commands in the CC field and execute them on the server. Specifically, the emails contain base-64 encoded strings that are executed via the 'sh' shell to build and drop a webshell on the Zimbra server. Once the webshell is installed, it listens for inbound connections containing a specific JSESSIONID cookie field. If the correct cookie is detected, the webshell parses another cookie (JACTION) that contains base64-encoded commands to execute. The webshell also supports downloading and executing files on the compromised server. Once installed, the webshell offers full access to the compromised Zimbra server for data theft or to further spread into the internal network. ProjectDiscovery researchers published a technical write-up last week on CVE-2024-45519, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that matches what is seen in the wild now. The researchers reverse-engineered Zimbra's patch to find that the 'popen' function, which receives user input, has been replaced with a new function named 'execvp,' which features an input sanitization mechanism. Working their way backward, they discovered that it's possible to send SMTP commands to Zimbra's postjournal service on port 10027, resulting in arbitrary command execution. The working exploit was also published in 'ready-to-use' Python script form on GitHub. Apart from applying the available security updates, the researchers also proposed that system administrators turn off 'postjournal' if it's not required for their operations and ensure that 'mynetworks' is correctly configured to prevent unauthorized access. According to Zimbra's security bulletin, CVE-2024-45519 has been resolved in version 9.0.0 Patch 41 or later, versions 10.0.9 and 10.1.1, and Zimbra 8.8.15 Patch 46 or later. Given the active exploitation status of the vulnerability, impacted users are strongly recommended to move to the new versions as soon as possible or at least apply the mitigation measures listed above.

        "text": "DrayTek has released security updates for multiple router models to address 14 vulnerabilities of varying severity, including a remote code execution flaw that received the maximum CVSS score of 10. The flaws, which Forescout Research – Vedere Labs discovered, impact both actively supported and models that have reached end-of-life. However, due to the severity, DrayTek has provided fixes for routers in both categories. The researchers warned that their scans revealed that approximately 785,000 DrayTek routers might be vulnerable to the newly discovered set of flaws, with over 704,500 having their web interface exposed to the internet. Most vulnerabilities discovered by Vedere Labs are medium-severity buffer overflow and cross-site scripting problems dictated by several exploitation requirements. However, five of the flaws carry significant risks, requiring immediate attention. Those are summarized as follows: As of yet, there have been no reports of active exploitation of these flaws, and the publication of analytical details has been withheld to allow users enough time to apply the security updates. The above flaws impact 24 router models, of which 11 have reached the end of life yet still received fixes. The impacted models and target firmware versions to upgrade to can be seen in the table below. Users may download the latest firmware for their device model from DrayTek's official download portal. Verdere Labs reports that it found over 704,500 devices have the DrayTek Vigor Web user interface exposed to the internet, though it should only be accessible from a local network. Nearly half of the devices under Forescout's direct visibility are located in the United States, but Shodan results show significant numbers in the United Kingdom, Vietnam, the Netherlands, and Australia. Apart from applying the latest firmware updates, users are recommended to take the following actions: All DrayTek users should confirm that their device's remote access console is disabled, as exploits and brute force attacks commonly target those services.

The attack compromised police office contact details, names, email addresses, phone numbers, and in some cases, private details. According to the original report, the attacker had hacked a police account and stole work-related contact details of multiple officers. The investigation is ongoing and the police decided not to reveal publicly who is responsible or how they carried out the attack until all the details have been collected and analyzed. Currently, the police are looking into the \"nature, scope, and consequences of the data leak.\" Politie says it has implemented stronger security measures to counter the attack, and added that they know exactly who is behind it, but don’t want to give away too much information at this point. Employees of the Dutch police force are now required to use two-factor authentication for logging into their accounts more frequently as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, all systems are being continuously monitored for any signs of abnormal activity, and the IT staff is on high alert to take immediate action. Although Politie did not specify how many people are impacted by this incident, a letter to the Dutch House of Representatives sent by David van Weel, Minister of Justice and Security in the Netherlands, informs that “work-related contact details of all police officers have been stolen.” Politie says that additional information will become public as soon as it is possible, as the details may affect the current investigation.

        "text": "Microsoft warns that ransomware threat actor Storm-0501 has recently switched tactics and now targets hybrid cloud environments, expanding its strategy to compromise all victim assets. The threat actor first emerged in 2021 as a ransomware affiliate for the Sabbath ransomware operation. Later they started to deploy file-encrypting malware from Hive, BlackCat, LockBit, and Hunters International gangs. Recently, they have been observed to deploy the Embargo ransomware. Storm-0501's recent attacks targeted hospitals, government, manufacturing, and transportation organizations, and law enforcement agencies in the United States. The attacker gains access to cloud environments by exploiting weak credentials and taking advantage of privileged accounts, with the goal of stealing data and executing a ransomware payload. Microsoft explains that the Storm-0501 obtains initial access to the network with stolen or purchased credentials, or by exploiting known vulnerabilities. Some of the flaws used in recent attacks are CVE-2022-47966 (Zoho ManageEngine), CVE-2023-4966 (Citrix NetScaler), and possibly CVE-2023-29300 or CVE-2023-38203 (ColdFusion 2016). The adversary moves laterally using frameworks like Impacket and Cobalt Strike, steals data through a custom Rclone binary renamed to mimic a Windows tool, and disables security agents with PowerShell cmdlets. By leveraging stolen Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) credentials, Storm-0501 moves from on-premise to cloud environments, compromising synchronization accounts and hijacking sessions for persistence. Microsoft Entra Connect Sync accounts are crucial for synchronizing data between on-premises Active Directory (AD) and cloud-based Microsoft Entra ID and typically allow a wide range of sensitive actions. If the attackers possess the credentials for the Directory Synchronization Account, they can use specialized tools like AADInternals to change cloud passwords, thus bypassing additional protections. If a domain admin or other high-privileged on-premises account also exists in the cloud environment and lacks proper protections (e.g. multi-factor authentication), Storm-0501 may use the same credentials to access the cloud again. After getting access to the cloud infrastructure, the threat actor plants a persistent backdoor by creating a new federated domain within the Microsoft Entra tenant, which allows them to authenticate as any user for which the \"Immutableid\" property is known or set by them. In the final step, the attackers will either deploy Embargo ransomware on the victim's on-premise and cloud environments or maintain backdoor access for a later time. \"Once the threat actor achieved sufficient control over the network, successfully extracted sensitive files, and managed to move laterally to the cloud environment, the threat actor then deployed the Embargo ransomware across the organization\" Microsoft \"We observed that the threat actor did not always resort to ransomware distribution, and in some cases only maintained backdoor access to the network,\" Microsoft said. The ransomware payload is deployed using compromised accounts like Domain Admin, via scheduled tasks or Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to encrypt files across the organization's devices. The Embargo threat group uses Rust-based malware to run their ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that accepts affiliates who breach companies to deploy the payload and share a part of the profit with the developers. In August 2024, an Embargo ransomware affiliate hit the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) and received $1 million in exchange for a working decryptor. Earlier this year, in May, an Embargo affiliate breached Firstmac Limited, one of Australia's largest mortgage lending and investment management firms, and leaked 500GB of stolen sensitive data when the deadline to negotiate a solution was reached. Ransomware gangs now abuse Microsoft Azure tool for data theft American Radio Relay League confirms $1 million ransom payment MoneyGram: No evidence ransomware is behind recent cyberattack Highline Public Schools confirms ransomware behind shutdown US sanctions crypto exchanges used by Russian ransomware gangs",

        "text": "The Evil Corp cybercrime syndicate has been hit with new sanctions by the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. The US also indicted one of its members for conducting BitPaymer ransomware attacks. In 2019, the United States sanctioned seventeen individuals and seven entities linked to the Evil Corp gang, including the group's leader, Maksim Yakubets. Today, the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned an additional seven individual and two entities associated with the cybercrime operation. In a trilateral action, the UK and Australia are also sanctioning some of the Evil Corp suspects designated by OFAC today or in its 2019 sanctions. The sanctioned individuals are Eduard Benderskiy (Maksim's father-in-law), Viktor Grigoryevich Yakubets (Maksim's father), Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov, Sergey Viktorovich Ryzhenkov, Aleksey Yevgenevich Shchetinin, Beyat Enverovich Ramazanov, and Vadim Gennadievich Pogodin. The two sanctioned entities are Vympel-Assistance LLC and Solar-Invest LLC, which are owned by Benderskiy, the reported father-in-law of Evil Corp's leader Maksim Yakubets. \"Eduard Benderskiy (Benderskiy), a former Spetnaz officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), which is designated under numerous OFAC sanctions authorities, current Russian businessman, and the father-in-law of Evil Corp's leader Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Maksim), has been a key enabler of Evil Corp's relationship with the Russian state,\" alleges the U.S. Department of the Treasury announcement. \"Benderskiy was a key enabler of their relationship with the Russian Intelligence Services who, prior to 2019, tasked Evil Corp to conduct cyber attacks and espionage operations against NATO allies,\" alleges a joint NCA announcement. As part of these sanctions, the individual's assets have been frozen and businesses in the US, UK, and Australia can no longer transact with them. This also means that organizations that suffer ransomware attacks by Evil Corp will no longer be able to make ransom payments without approval by OFAC or risk facing sanction violations. The United States also unsealed an indictment today against suspected Evil Corp member Aleksandr Ryzhenkov for conducting ransomware attacks on multiple victims in the US. Ryzhenkov is charged with utilizing the BitPaymer ransomware in multiple attacks against companies in the United States. BitPaymer is the first ransomware encryptor created by Evil Corp, which they began using in attacks in 2017. \"According to the indictment, beginning in at least June 2017, Ryzhenkov allegedly gained unauthorized access to the information stored on victims' computer networks,\" reads the DOJ announcement. \"Ryzhenkov and his conspirators then allegedly deployed the strain of ransomware known as BitPaymer and used it to encrypt the files of the victim companies, rendering them inaccessible. An electronic note left on the victims' systems contained a ransom demand and instructions on how to contact the attackers to begin ransom negotiations. \"Ryzhenkov and his conspirators allegedly demanded that victims pay a ransom to obtain a decryption key and prevent their sensitive information from being made public online.\" As part of Operation Cronos, the NCA also identified Ryzhenkov as a LockBit affiliate, under which he attacked numerous organizations. \"He has also been identified as a LockBit affiliate as part of Operation Cronos - the ongoing NCA-led international disruption of the group,\" reads the NCA announcement. \"Investigators analysing data obtained from the group's own systems found he has been involved in LockBit ransomware attacks against numerous organisations.\" Ryzhenkov is part of those sanctioned today by OFAC, the UK, and Australia and is believed to live in Russia. Evil Corp is a cybercrime syndicate known for creating and distributing the Dridex banking Trojan and various ransomware families used in attacks worldwide. When first started, the cybercrime gang used the Dridex trojan to conduct financial fraud by stealing online banking credentials and then using them to transfer funds to bank accounts under their control. In 2017, as enterprise-targeting ransomware attacks began emerging, the gang created BitPaymer ransomware to use in attacks against companies worldwide. In 2019, Evil Corp split, with some members creating a new ransomware operation known as DoppelPaymer, which shared much of the same code as BitPaymer. DoppelPaymer continued to attack organizations through 2022, rebranding twice as Grief (a.k.a. Pay or Grief) and Entropy ransomware. After the US charged members of the Evil Corp for stealing over $100 million, it added the gang's leader, Maksim Yakubets, and other members of the cybercrime gang to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction list. Due to these sanctions, many ransomware negotiation firms refused to conduct payments with Evil Corp operations due to the risks of violating sanctions. Evil Corp deployed new ransomware variants under different names to evade US sanctions, such as WastedLocker, Hades, Phoenix CryptoLocker, PayLoadBin, and Macaw. However, as all of these encryptors shared a common code base, they were easily identified as belonging to Evil Corp. This led some of the gang's affiliates to utilize the LockBit ransomware in attacks to evade sanctions further.

        "text": "A new 'FakeUpdate' campaign targeting users in France leverages compromised websites to show fake browser and application updates that spread a new version of the WarmCookie backdoor. FakeUpdate is a cyberattack strategy used by a threat group known as 'SocGolish' who compromises or creates fake websites to show visitors fake update prompts for a variety of applications, such as web browsers, Java, VMware Workstation, WebEx, and Proton VPN. When users click on update prompts designed to appear legitimate, a fake update is downloaded that drops a malicious payload, like info-stealers, cryptocurrency drainers, RATs, and even ransomware. The latest campaign was discovered by researchers at Gen Threat Labs, who observed the WarmCookie backdoor being distributed as fake Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Java updates. WarmCookie, first discovered by eSentire in mid-2023, is a Windows backdoor recently seen distributed in phishing campaigns using fake job offers as lures. Its broad capabilities include data and file theft, device profiling, program enumeration (via the Windows Registry), arbitrary command execution (via CMD), screenshot capturing, and the ability to introduce additional payloads on the infected system. In the latest campaign spotted by Gen Threat Labs, the WarmCookie backdoor has been updated with new features, including running DLLs from the temp folder and sending back the output, as well as the ability to transfer and execute EXE and PowerShell files. The lure used to trigger the infection is a fake browser update, which is common for FakeUpdate attacks. However, Gen Digital also found a site where a fake Java update was promoted in this campaign. The infection chain starts with the user clicking on a fake browser update notice, which triggers JavaScript that fetches the WarmCookie installer and prompts the user to save the file. When the fake software update is executed, the malware performs some anti-VM checks to ensure it's not running on an analyst's environment and sends the newly infected system's fingerprint to the command and control (C2) server, awaiting instructions. Although Gen Threat Labs says the attackers use compromised websites in this campaign, some of the domains shared in the IoC section, like \"edgeupdate[.]com\" and \"mozilaupgrade[.]com,\" seem specifically selected to match the 'FakeUpdate' theme. Remember, Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox, and all modern browsers are automatically updated when new updates become available. A program restart may be needed for an update to be applied to the browser, but manually downloading and executing updater packages is never a part of an actual update process and should be seen as a sign of danger. In many cases, FakeUpdates compromise legitimate and otherwise trustworthy websites, so these pop-ups should be treated with caution even when you're on a familiar platform.

        "text": "The notorious APT hacking group known as FIN7 has launched a network of fake AI-powered deepnude generator sites to infect visitors with information-stealing malware. FIN7 is believed to be a Russian hacking group that has been conducting financial fraud and cybercrime since 2013, with ties to ransomware gangs, such as DarkSide, BlackMatter, and BlackCat, who recently conducted an exit scam after stealing a $20 million UnitedHealth ransom payment. FIN7 is known for its sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks, such as impersonating BestBuy to send malicious USB keys or creating a fake security company to hire pentesters and developers for ransomware attacks without them knowing. So it's not surprising to find that they have now been linked to an intricate network of websites promoting AI-powered deepnude generators that claim to create fake nude versions of photos of clothed individuals. The technology has been controversial due to the harm it can cause to the subjects by creating non-consensual explicit images, and it has even been outlawed in many places in the world. However, the interest in this technology remains strong. FIN7's fake deepnude sites serve as honeypots for people interested in generating deepfake nudes of celebrities or other people. In 2019, threat actors used a similar lure to spread info-stealing malware even before the AI explosion. The network of deepnude generators operates under the same \"AI Nude\" brand and is promoted through black hat SEO tactics to rank the sites high in search results. According to Silent Push, FIN7 directly operated sites like \"aiNude[.]ai\", \"easynude[.]website\", and nude-ai[.]pro,\" which offered \"free trials\" or \"free downloads,\" but in reality just spread malware. All the sites use a similar design that promises the ability to generate free AI deepnude images from any uploaded photo. The fake websites allow users to upload photos that they would like to create deepfake nudes. However, after the alleged \"deepnude\" is made, it is not displayed on the screen. Instead, the user is prompted to click a link to download the generated image. Doing so will bring the user to another site that displays a password and a link for a password-protected archive hosted on Dropbox. While this site is still alive, the Dropbox link no longer works. However, instead of a deepnude image, the archive archive contains the Lumma Stealer information-stealing malware. When executed, the malware will steal credentials and cookies saved in web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data from the computer. Silent Push also saw some sites promoting a deepnude generation program for Windows that would instead deploy Redline Stealer and D3F@ck Loader, which are also used to steal information from compromised devices. All seven sites detected by Silent Push have since been taken down, but users who might have downloaded files from them should consider themselves infected. Silent Push also identified parallel FIN7 campaigns dropping NetSupport RAT through websites that prompt visitors to install a browser extension. In other cases, FIN7 uses payloads that appear to spoof well-known brands and applications such as Cannon, Zoom, Fortnite, Fortinet VPN, Razer Gaming, and PuTTY. These payloads may be distributed to victims using SEO tactics and malvertising, tricking them into downloading trojanized installers. FIN7 was recently exposed for selling its custom \"AvNeutralizer\" EDR killing tool to other cybercriminals, targeting IT staff of car makers in phishing attacks, and deploying Cl0p ransomware in attacks against organizations.

        "text": "Two Chinese nationals were sentenced to prison for scamming Apple out of more than $2.5 million after exchanging over 6,000 counterfeit iPhones for authentic ones. Between July 2017 and December 2019, Haotian Sun, Pengfei Xue, and their co-conspirators, Wen Jin Gao and Dian Luo, exploited Apple's device replacement policy to replace non-functioning fake iPhones for genuine devices. Their goal was to \"unjustly enrich themselves by fraudulently obtaining authentic iPhones from Apple after submitting inauthentic iPhones to Apple for repair and replacement,\" according to the court documents. The counterfeit iPhones were shipped from Hong Kong to commercial mail receiving agency (CMRA) mailboxes in United Parcel Service (UPS) stores in the United States. To open these mailboxes, they used their actual university identification cards and driver's licenses. As discovered by the investigators, they submitted these fake iPhones with spoofed IMEIs and serial numbers to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers. Apple sent them replacement iPhones via private and commercial interstate carriers (including FedEx, DLH, and UPS). The devices were then shipped back to Hong Kong, where they were sold, and the proceeds were shared among the conspirators. Their return fraud scheme was possible because Apple customers can return faulty iPhones via mail, at Apple retail stores, or through Apple Authorized Service Providers and exchange them for new ones within one year of purchase under the company's warranty service and handset replacement program. \"Members of the conspiracy submitted more than 6,000 inauthentic phones to Apple during the conspiracy, causing a loss of more than $2.5 million,\" the Justice Department said in a press release published today. Sun and Xue were arrested by U.S. postal inspectors in December 2019 and were both convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud in February. Sun was sentenced to 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release, while Xue received a 54-month prison sentence followed by three years of supervised release. The court also ordered them to pay Apple $1,072,200 and $397,800 in restitution, respectively.

The notification left users panicking and voicing their concerns on social media amid concerns they had been victims of a compromise. For many, the payment card being referred to had been issued years ago and presently expired, which added to the confusion. Between Wednesday and Thursday this week, several Google Pay users received the following email about a new card being added to their Google Pay account: For several users including myself, the card in question had been \"expired\" and had not been used in a long time, which led to confusion. Concerned users took to social media and Google's support forums, seeking clarification on these notifications and if they had been victims of a compromise. Google Pay user Arran Dickson reported receiving the \"odd 4am email\" notification about an old expired card and asked Google if this was a cause for concern. Others chimed in, including systems engineer Anthony Parkes, who states having received 15 such emails which made him wonder if he had been hacked. Google's support forums also had the topic \"trending\" with hundreds of upvotes from panicky users. Similar threads [1, 2] surfaced on Reddit. On Saturday, Google sent out an additional email to impacted users stating that the previous email notification was \"accidental\" and that there was no cause for concern: The subsequent correction sent from the Google Pay team stated: \"You may have received one or more emails about payment methods being added to your Google Account. If you received one of these emails, it was an error that has been resolved. We apologize for the inconvenience. There was no unauthorized access to your Google Account, and none of your information was compromised. You do not need to take any action. You can review your payment methods at any time in your Google Account. Thanks, The Google Pay team\" As such, those who received unexpected 'new card' emails this week can safely disregard them. As a best practice, users should regularly review payment methods and transactions listed under their Google Accounts and similar digital wallet products.",

        "text": "Over the weekend, Google removed Kaspersky's Android security apps from the Google Play store and disabled the Russian company's developer accounts. Users have been reporting over the last week that Kaspersky's products (including Kaspersky Endpoint Security and VPN & Antivirus by Kaspersky) are no longer available on Google Play in the United States and other world regions. Kaspersky confirmed the issue on the company's official forums on Sunday and said that it's currently investigating why its software is no longer available on Google's app store. \"The downloads and updates of Kaspersky products are temporarily unavailable on the Google Play store,\" a Kaspersky employee said. \"Kaspersky is currently investigating the circumstances behind the issue and exploring potential solutions to ensure that users of its products can continue downloading and updating their applications from Google Play.\" While the apps are unavailable, Kaspersky advised users to install them from alternative app stores, including the Galaxy Store, Huawei AppGallery, and Xiaomi GetApps. The company's security apps can also be installed by downloading the .apk installation file from Kaspersky's website. This support page provides more information on how to install and activate Kaspersky's software on Android devices. This comes after Kaspersky told BleepingComputer in July that it would shut down its United States operations after the U.S. government sanctioned the company and 12 executives and banned Kaspersky antivirus software over national security concerns in June. In a statement earlier today, Google confirmed this prompted the decision to block Kaspersky and its products on the Google Play store. \"The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security recently announced a variety of restrictions on Kaspersky. As a result, we have removed Kaspersky’s apps from Google Play,\" a Google spokesperson told BleepingComputer. In September, the Russian multinational cybersecurity company deleted its anti-malware software from customers' computers across the United States and replaced it with UltraAV's antivirus solution without informing its customers or asking for permission. Update October 04, 13:23 EDT: Added Google statement. Android malware 'Necro' infects 11 million devices via Google Play ‘Pig butchering’ trading apps found on Google Play, App Store Fake WalletConnect app on Google Play steals Android users’ crypto Kaspersky deletes itself, installs UltraAV antivirus without warning Google sees 68% drop in Android memory safety flaws over 5 years",

        "text": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Robert B. Westbrook, a U.K. citizen, with hacking into the computer systems of five U.S. public companies to access confidential earnings information and conduct insider trading. Westbrook then used this nonpublic information to make trades ahead of 14 earnings announcements between January 2019 and August 2020, earning approximately $3,750,000 in illicit profits. This activity is known as “insider trading,” where an unauthorized individual makes investments based on confidential information not available to the general public. The British hacker allegedly breached the companies by resetting the passwords of senior executives in the targeted organizations and then hijacking them to access documents or emails containing financial and earnings reports. Access to email accounts would allow the man to easily wipe traces of this activity, including deleting the password reset alerts or using forwarding rules. Additionally, Westbrook used anonymous email accounts, VPN services, and Bitcoin to perform the illegal investments while hiding his identity. However, the SEC says it was still able to track him down using data analytics. Westbrook now faces both civil charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and criminal charges from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. The SEC charged Westbrook with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, while the criminal charges will likely comprise wire fraud, securities fraud, and unauthorized access to computer systems (hacking). The above could carry significant prison sentences, hefty fines, often higher than the profit gained from illicit investment activities, and an order barring Westbrook from trading in securities in the future.

        "text": "The RansomHub ransomware gang is behind the recent cyberattack on oil and gas services giant Halliburton, which disrupted the company's IT systems and business operations. The attack caused widespread disruption, and BleepingComputer was told that customers couldn't generate invoices or purchase orders because the required systems were down. Halliburton disclosed the attack last Friday in an SEC filing, stating they suffered a cyberattack on August 21, 2024, by an unauthorized party. \"On August 21, 2024, Halliburton Company (the \"Company\") became aware that an unauthorized third party gained access to certain of its systems,\" read Halliburton's SEC filing. \"When the Company learned of the issue, the Company activated its cybersecurity response plan and launched an investigation internally with the support of external advisors to assess and remediate the unauthorized activity.\" The company provides a numerous services to oil and gas companies, including well construction, drilling, hydraulic fracturing (fracking), and IT software and services. Due to the company's wide range of services, there is a great deal of connectivity between them and their customers. However, the company has not shared many details about the attack, with a customer in the oil and gas industry telling BleepingComputer that they have been left in the dark about determining if the attack impacted them and how to protect themselves. This has caused other customers to disconnect from Halliburton due to the lack of information being shared. BleepingComputer has also been told that some companies are working with ONG-ISAC—an agency that acts as a central point of coordination and communication for physical and cybersecurity threats against the oil and gas industry—to receive technical information about the attack to determine if they were breached as well. For days, there have been rumors that Halliburton suffered a RansomHub ransomware attack, with users claiming this on Reddit and on the job layoff discussion site, TheLayoff, where a partial RansomHub ransom note was published. When BleepingComputer contacted Halliburton about these claims, Halliburton said they were not making any further comments. \"We are not commenting beyond what was included in our filing. Any subsequent communications will be in the form of an 8-K,\" Halliburton told BleepingComputer. However, in an August 26 email sent to suppliers and shared with BleepingComputer, Halliburton provided additional information stating that the company took systems offline to protect them and is working with Mandiant to investigate the incident. \"We are reaching out to update you about a cybersecurity issue affecting Halliburton,\" reads the letter seen by BleepingComputer. \"As soon as we learned of the issue, we activated our cybersecurity response plan and took steps to address it, including (1) proactively taking certain systems offline to help protect them, (2) engaging the support of leading external advisors, including Mandiant, and (3) notifying law enforcement.\" They also stated that their email systems continue to operate as they’re hosted on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. A workaround is also available for transacting and issuing purchase orders. This email includes a list of IOCs containing file names and IP addresses associated with the attack that customers can use to detect similar activity on their network. One of these IOCs is for a Windows executable named maintenance.exe, which BleepingComputer has confirmed to be a RansomHub ransomware encryptor. After analyzing the sample, it appears to be a newer version than previously analyzed, as it contains a new \"-cmd string\" command-line argument, which will execute a command on the device before encrypting files. The RansomHub ransomware operation launched in February 2024, claiming it was a data theft extortion and extortion group that sold stolen files to the highest bidder. However, soon after, it was discovered that the operation also utilized ransomware encryptors in its double-extortion attacks, where the threat actors breached networks, stole data, and then encrypted files. The encrypted files and the threat to leak stolen data were then used as leverage to scare companies into paying a ransom. Symantec analyzed the ransomware encryptors and reported that they were based on the Knight ransomware encryptors, formerly known as Cyclops. The Knight operation claimed they sold their source code in February 2024 and shut down just as RansomHub launched. This has made many researchers believe that RansomHub is a rebrand of the Knight ransomware operation. Today, the FBI released an advisory about RansomHub, sharing the threat actor’s tactics and warning that they breached at least 210 victims since February. It is common for the FBI and CISA to publish coordinated advisories on threat actors soon after they conduct a highly impactful attack on critical infrastructure, such as Halliburton. However, it is not known if the advisory and the attack are linked. Since the start of the year, RansomHub has been responsible for numerous high-profile attacks, including those on American not-for-profit credit union Patelco, the Rite Aid drugstore chain, the Christie's auction house, and U.S. telecom provider Frontier Communications. The ransomware operation's data leak site was also utilized to leak stolen data belonging to Change Healthcare following the shutdown of the BlackCat and ALPHV ransomware operation. It is believed that after BlackCat shut down, some of its affiliates moved to RansomHub, allowing them to quickly escalate their attacks with experienced ransomware threat actors.

        "text": "On Thursday, K-12 school district Highline Public Schools confirmed that a ransomware attack forced it to shut down all schools in early September. Highline Public Schools has over 2,000 staff members and offers programs ranging from early childhood education to college preparation. It serves over 17,500 students across 34 schools in the Burien, Des Moines, Normandy Park, SeaTac, and White Center communities in Washington State. After discovering evidence of unauthorized activity on its network following a September 7 security breach, the school district was forced to shut down all schools and cancel school activities. Highline's central office remained open, and staff were instructed to report for work. The district also started investigating the attack's impact and working to restore systems with help from third-party, state, and federal partners. \"In response, a third-party cybersecurity forensic specialist was engaged, and an investigation was launched, which confirmed that the unauthorized activity was a form of ransomware,\" the school district said this week. \"We notified the FBI of this activity, and we are working to support their investigation. Due to the nature of the investigation, we cannot comment on any potential law enforcement investigation at this time.\" The district is still rebuilding affected network systems to come back online and says it will start re-imaging all student and staff devices starting October 14. \"We are working to rebuild our network systems. Beginning the week of October 14, technology services staff will prompt all staff and students to update their network passwords. Additionally, we will re-image all district-provided Windows devices,\" it added. \"We expect to restore access to several of our network tools during the week of October 14. We are prioritizing access to tools that are authenticated through ClassLink.\" The only devices that won't have to be re-imaged are Chromebooks and Apple devices, although tech staff and students will first have to reset passwords before using them. No other details are available regarding the ransomware operation behind last month's cyberattack, and it's currently unclear whether any personal information belonging to staff or students was exposed or stolen in the incident. However, as a precaution, the district provides all Highline employees one year of free credit and identity monitoring services. The ransomware attack on Highline Public Schools' network is the latest in a series of cyberattacks that have affected school districts and systems across North America and worldwide. For instance, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB)—the fourth largest school board in North America and the largest in Canada—warned in June that it was hit by a ransomware attack that impacted its software testing environment. In June, attackers also breached the Mobile Guardian digital classroom management platform and remotely wiped datafrom around 13,000 iPads and Chromebooks used by students across North America, Europe, and Singapore.

        "text": "The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging three Iranian hackers with a \"hack-and-leak\" campaign that aimed to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Iranian nationals Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri, and Yaser Balaghi worked for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to hack the accounts of current and former U.S. officials, individuals linked to multiple U.S. political campaigns, and media members. According to the DOJ, their attacks were part of a broader Iranian effort attempting to steal sensitive information about American officials and influence U.S. elections. In May 2024, after years of targeting former U.S. government officials, the trio shifted their focus to individuals connected to the Trump presidential campaign, the indictment alleges. They successfully gained unauthorized access to campaign officials' personal accounts, stealing campaign documents and emails. Around late June, the hackers began a \"hack-and-leak\" operation, attempting to leak stolen materials to U.S. media outlets and individuals associated with the Biden campaign, intending to damage Trump's 2024 presidential bid. \"Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden's campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former Trump's campaign as text in the emails,\" according to a joint statement released on September 18 by CISA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \"There is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump's campaign to U.S. media organizations.\" ​Their \"hack-and-leak\" operation started in January 2020 and involved spearphishing and social engineering tactics. By 2022, they expanded their efforts and targeted a former U.S. government official to steal personal information that could help identify future victims. Iranian nationals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have been indicted for a \"hack-and-leak\" operation targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election. #FBI Director Wray condemns these efforts to sow discord in American politics, asserting that threats to democracy… pic.twitter.com/Wq67SvbLap The U.S. State Department also offers a $10 million reward for information on Jalili, Aghamiri, and Balaghi. At the same time, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) has designated Jalili for his involvement with the IRGC, imposing sanctions as part of ongoing efforts to curb foreign interference in U.S. elections. \"These hack-and-leak efforts by Iran are a direct assault on the integrity of our democratic processes,\" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen. \"This indictment alleges a serious and sustained effort by a state-sponsored terrorist organization to gather intelligence through hacking personal accounts so they can use the hacked materials to harm Americans and corruptly influence our election,\" U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves for the District of Columbia added today.

        "text": "Japan's Computer Emergency Response Center (JPCERT/CC) has shared tips on detecting different ransomware gang's attacks based on entries in Windows Event Logs, providing timely detection of ongoing attacks before they spread too far into a network. JPCERT/CC says the technique can be valuable when responding to ransomware attacks, and identifying the attack vector among various possibilities is crucial for timely mitigation. The investigation strategy proposed by JPCERT/CC covers four types of Windows Event Logs: Application, Security, System, and Setup logs. These logs often contain traces left behind by ransomware attacks that could reveal the entry points used by the attackers and their \"digital identity.\" Here are some examples of ransomware traces highlighted in the agency's report: JPCERT/CC also notes that seemingly unrelated ransomware variants such as Shade, GandCrab, AKO, AvosLocker, BLACKBASTA, and Vice Society, leave behind very similar traces (event IDs: 13, 10016). Both errors are caused by a lack of permissions when accessing COM applications to delete Volume Shadow Copies, which ransomware typically deletes to prevent easy restoration of encrypted files. It's important to note that no detection method should be taken as a guarantee for adequate protection against ransomware, but monitoring for specific logs can prove game-changing when combined with other measures to detect attacks before they spread too far into a network. JPCERT/CC notes that older ransomware strains such as WannaCry and Petya did not leave traces in Windows logs, but the situation has changed on modern malware, so the technique is now considered effective. In 2022, SANS also shared a guide on detecting different ransomware families using Windows Event Logs.

        "text": "A Linux malware named \"perfctl\" has been targeting Linux servers and workstations for at least three years, remaining largely undetected through high levels of evasion and the use of rootkits. According to Aqua Nautilus researchers who discovered perfctl, the malware likely targeted millions of Linux servers in recent years and possibly caused infections in several thousands of them. This is based on numerous reports by victims of the malware submitted to online discussion forums, all containing indicators of compromise exclusively associated with perfctl activity. According to Aqua Nautilus, the primary purpose of perfctl is for cryptomining, using the compromised servers to mine the hard-to-trace Monero cryptocurrency. However, it could be easily used for more damaging operations. Aqua Nautilus believes that the threat actors exploit misconfigurations or exposed secrets to breach Linux servers. These misconfigurations range from publicly accessible files that contain credentials to exposed login interfaces. The researchers have also observed exploitation of CVE-2023-33246, a remote command execution impacting Apache RocketMQ versions 5.1.0 and older, and CVE-2021-4034 (PwnKit), an elevation of privilege flaw in Polkit. Once initial access is established, the packed and obfuscated payload, named \"httpd,\" is downloaded from the attacker's server and executed. It then copies itself in the /tmp directory under the \"sh\" name and then deletes the original binary. The new process assumes the same name (\"sh\"), essentially blending with normal Linux system operations. Additional copies are created in other system locations, such as \"/root/.config,\" \"/usr/bin/\" and \"usr/lib\" to ensure persistence in the case of a cleanup. When launched, perfctl opens a Unix socket for internal communications and establishes an encrypted channel with the threat actor's servers over TOR, making it impossible to decipher the exchange. It then drops a rootkit named 'libgcwrap.so' which hooks into various system functions to modify authentication mechanisms and intercept network traffic as needed to facilitate evasion. Additional userland rootkits are also deployed, replacing the ldd, top, crontab, and lsof utilities with trojanized versions, again, preventing direct detection of the malware's activities. Finally, an XMRIG miner is dropped onto the system and executed to mine Monero using the server's CPU resources. The cryptominer communicates with the set mining pools over TOR, so the network traffic is obscured, and the profits cannot be traced. In some cases, Aqua Nautilus has also seen the deployment of proxy-jacking software giving the attackers an additional monetization route, selling unused network bandwidth through Bitping, Repocket, Speedshare, and other similar services. Most users become suspicious that their servers are infected after they notice that the CPU is at 100% utilization due to the it mining for cryptocurrency. However, the malware is highly evasive, carrying out the mining activities until a user logs into the server, which causes it to stop immediately and wait until the server is idle again. \"I only became aware of the malware because my monitoring setup alerted me to 100% CPU utilization,\" reported a user on Reddit. \"However, the process would stop immediately when I logged in via SSH or console. As soon as I logged out, the malware would resume running within a few seconds or minutes.\" Using rootkits also makes it difficult to remove as the processes are hidden from userland utilities and normal malware removal techniques, commonly requiring users to take it offline or boot via a live CD to inspect the filesystem. However, as the infection modifies and replaces legitimate Linux files, the best suggestion is to wipe and reinstall the device to ensure that nothing is left behind. Aqua Nautilus proposes several ways for detecting and stopping perfctl, which fall into four main categories: system monitoring, network traffic analysis, file and process integrity monitoring, and proactive mitigation. Regarding detection, the following tips are provided by Aqua Nautilus: System admins should ensure that all known flaws on internet-facing applications such as RocketMQ servers (CVE-2023-33246) and Polkit (CVE-2021-4043) are patched. Also, it would be effective to turn off unused HTTP services, use role-based access controls, and apply the 'noexec' option to critical directories like '/tmp' and '/dev.shm.'

        "text": "The Corona Mirai-based malware botnet is spreading through a 5-year-old remote code execution (RCE) zero-day in AVTECH IP cameras, which have been discontinued for years and will not receive a patch. The flaw, discovered by Akamai's Aline Eliovich, is tracked as CVE-2024-7029 and is a high-severity (CVSS v4 score: 8.7) issue in the \"brightness\" function of the cameras, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject commands over the network using specially crafted requests. Specifically, the easy-to-exploit flaw lies in the \"brightness\" argument in the \"action=\" parameter of the AVTECH cameras' firmware, intended to allow remote adjustments to the brightness of a camera. The flaw impacts all AVTECH AVM1203 IP cameras running on firmware versions up to Fullmg-1023-1007-1011-1009. Due to the impacted models no longer being supported by the Taiwanese vendor, having reached their end of life (EoL) in 2019, no patch is available to address CVE-2024-7029, and no fixes are expected to be released. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an advisory at the start of the month to warn about CVE-2024-7029 and the availability of public exploits, warning that the cameras are still used in commercial facilities, financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation systems. Proof of concept (PoC) exploits for the particular flaw have been available since at least 2019, but a CVE was only assigned this month, and no active exploitation had been observed previously. Corona is a Mirai-based variant that has been around since at least 2020, exploiting various vulnerabilities in IoT devices to propagate. Akamai's SIRT team reports that starting on March 18, 2024, Corona began leveraging CVE-2024-7029 in attacks in the wild, targeting AVM1203 cameras still in service despite them having reached EoL five years ago. The first active campaign we observed began on March 18, 2024, but analysis showed activity for this variant as early as December 2023. The proof of concept (PoC) for CVE-2024-7029 has been publicly available since at least February 2019, but it never had a proper CVE assignment until August 2024. The Corona attacks, as those have been captured in Akamai's honeypots, exploit CVE-2024-7029 to download and execute a JavaScript file, which, in turn, loads the primary botnet payload onto the device. Once nested on the device, the malware connects to its command and control (C2) servers and awaits instructions on executing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Other flaws targeted by Corona, according to Akamai's analysis, are: Users of AVTECH AVM1203 IP cameras are recommended to take them offline immediately and replace them with newer and actively supported models. As IP cameras are commonly exposed to the internet, making them attractive targets for threat actors, they should always run the latest firmware version to ensure known bugs are fixed. If a device becomes discontinued, it should be replaced with newer models to continue receiving security updates. Furthermore, default credentials should be changed to strong and unique passwords and they should be separated from critical or production networks.

        "text": "Global news agency AFP (Agence France-Presse) is warning that it suffered a cyberattack on Friday, which impacted IT systems and content delivery services for its partners. The news organization says the attack does not impact news coverage worldwide but has impacted some client services. AFP's IT staff is working with France's cybersecurity agency (ANSSI) to mitigate the attack and resolve its repercussions. As for the type of the attack and the perpetrators, no details were provided. \"Agence France-Presse detected an attack on its IT systems on Friday, affecting part of its delivery service to clients. It is not yet known who carried out this attack or why,\" reads the statement. \"AFP's technical teams are working on the incident with the support of the French National Agency for IT Systems Security (ANSSI).\" AFP is an award-winning Paris-based news agency with a presence in 150 countries, employing over 2,400 people in 260 cities, and covering news in French, English, Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. Although the news agency did not specify what specific client services were impacted by the cyberattack, they are known to provide real-time news feeds, subscription-based content services, custom news packages, and content archives, some of which may be currently unavailable. In an email seen by BleepingComputer, the company warned other media company that the cyberattack may have also compromised FTP credentials used to receive AFP content. \"As a reminder, the passwords on your FTP servers that receive AFP content may have been compromised. Therefore, we recommend you change your passwords and check all your reception systems are secure,\" reads AFP's email to partners. If you have any information regarding this incident or any other undisclosed attacks, you can contact us confidentially via Signal at 646-961-3731 or at tips@bleepingcomputer.com. BleepingComputer has contacted AFP and ANSSI to learn more about the cyberattack and its potential impact, but we have not yet received a response from either. At the time of writing, no ransomware gangs or other threat actors have assumed responsibility for the attack at AFP. France has had its fair share of high-impact cyberattacks this year, some threatening the organizations during crucial times, and others impacting tens of millions of people. In February, a data breach at French healthcare service providers Viamedis and Almerys exposed the details of 33 million people. In March, France's unemployment agency, Pôle Emploi, informed the public that hackers had breached its systems and accessed the personal details of around 43 million registered citizens. In April, Hospital Simone Veil in Cannes (CHC-SV), an 840-bed hospital, announced it was targeted by a cyberattack later claimed by Lockbit 3.0. Finally, during the Olympic Games in August, threat actors successfully impacted the Grand Palais Réunion des musées nationaux (Rmn), a museum management institution and cultural site itself.

        "text": "Microsoft and the Justice Department have seized over 100 domains used by the Russian ColdRiver hacking group to target United States government employees and nonprofit organizations from Russia and worldwide in spear-phishing attacks. In December, the United Kingdom and its Five Eyes allies linked this threat group to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the country's internal security and counterintelligence service. According to a partially unsealed affidavit, they attacked a wide range of targets, including United States-based companies and former and current employees of the United States Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, and Department of State, as well as staff at the Department of Energy and U.S. military defense contractors. \"Between January 2023 and August 2024, Microsoft observed Star Blizzard target over 30 civil society organizations – journalists, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) core to ensuring democracy can thrive – by deploying spear-phishing campaigns to exfiltrate sensitive information and interfere in their activities,\" said Steven Masada, Assistant General Counsel at Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit. Together, Microsoft and the DOJ seized 107 domains—66 by Microsoft and 41 by the DOJ—dismantling the attack infrastructure used by ColdRiver hackers in ongoing attacks. \"The Russian government ran this scheme to steal Americans' sensitive information, using seemingly legitimate email accounts to trick victims into revealing account credentials,\" stated Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \"This seizure is part of a coordinated response with our private sector partners to dismantle the infrastructure that cyber espionage actors use to attack U.S. and international targets,\" U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey added. Also tracked as Callisto Group, Seaborgium, and Star Blizzard, the ColdRiver threat group has used open-source intelligence (OSINT) and social engineering skills to research and lure targets since at least 2017. Five Eyes cyber agencies warned in December 2023 of ColdRiver's spear-phishing attacks against academia, defense, governmental organizations, NGOs, think tanks, and politicians. In 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine, these attacks expanded to defense-industrial targets and U.S. Department of Energy facilities. Microsoft previously thwarted ColdRiver attacks against several European NATO nations by disabling the Microsoft accounts they used to harvest emails and monitor their victims' activity. In December, the U.S. State Department sanctioned two ColdRiver operators (one of them an FSB officer) who the DOJ also indicted for their involvement in a global hacking campaign coordinated by the Russian government. The State Department now offers up to $10 million in rewards for information that could help locate or identify other ColdRiver members.

        "text": "Microsoft Defender now automatically detects and notifies users with a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription when they're connected to unsecured Wi-Fi networks. The Defender privacy protection feature (also known as Defender VPN) protects your privacy and security when connected to public Wi-Fi or an untrusted network, where your data and identity could be exposed or stolen. To do that, it encrypts and routes your internet traffic through Microsoft's servers and hides your internet address (IP address) using a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Microsoft announced today that Defender VPN has been upgraded to automatically alert users they're exposed to attacks and can now be configured to enable automatically for better safety. \"We've added detection for un-safe Wi-Fi (suspicious Wi-Fi). These detections are possible using Defender heuristics that examine multiple characteristics of a Wi-Fi hotspot to determine if it is suspicious,\" Microsoft said. \"As with unsecure Wi-Fi, you get a notification for un-safe Wi- Fi as well and can turn on Defender VPN for added safety.\" This can help defend you against attackers setting up a rogue wireless access point to trick users into connecting to it in Evil Twin attacks. After the victims connect, they can steal sensitive information in Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks or use phishing techniques to get more information. ​The unsafe Wi-Fi alerts are now only available in Defender for Android, iOS, and Windows, with macOS support also to roll out soon. The company has also added support for Defender VPN on Windows and macOS systems and made it available in Germany and Canada. More countries will be added in the upcoming months. \"We're adding privacy protection to ten additional countries in Europe, Asia, and LATAM regions soon,\" said Microsoft. First introduced one year ago in September 2023 on Android devices in the United States, privacy protection is a feature included with Microsoft Defender for individuals. It's important to note that Microsoft says that Defender VPN will send anonymized service data to the company's servers but won't collect browsing data, history, personal details, or your device's physical location. This anonymized service data contains details like the duration of the VPN's use, the amount of VPN bandwidth used, and the Wi-Fi hotspot names detected as potentially malicious for threat research purposes (the company says the latter is only sent to its servers after user consent is provided). If you're not a Microsoft Defender user with a Microsoft 365 Family or Personal subscription, you can also protect yourself by enabling multi-factor authentication on as many of your accounts as possible and turning off automatic Wi-Fi connections to ensure your device doesn't connect to potentially malicious wireless networks. Windows Server August updates fix Microsoft 365 Defender issue This hardware VPN router is cheaper many software subscriptions Microsoft fixes Outlook email sending issue for users with many folders Get Office apps, OneDrive, and more with 42% off Microsoft 365 A three-year subscription to WindScribe VPN is now down to $79",

        "text": "Payment platform MoneyGram says there is no evidence that ransomware is behind a recent cyberattack that led to a five-day outage in September. MoneyGram is an American payment and money transfer platform that allows people to send and receive money through an extensive network of 350,000 physical locations in 200 countries or via its mobile app and website. MoneyGram confirmed they had suffered a cyberattack and took systems offline to contain the breach on September 20, three days after customers started reporting experiencing issues. The disruption to IT systems prevented customers from being able to access and transfer their money and perform other online activities. While many suspected it was a ransomware attack, MoneyGram shared no further details, and no ransomware gangs claimed responsibility. In an email with updated information about the cyberattack sent to stakeholders on September 25 and seen by BleepingComputer, MoneyGram said that customers are finally able to transfer funds again. MoneyGram confirmed that corporate systems were breached, but after investigating the attack with CrowdStrike, law enforcement, and other cybersecurity professionals said there was no evidence that ransomware was behind the attack. \"After working with leading external cybersecurity experts, including CrowdStrike, and coordinating with U.S. law enforcement, the majority of our systems are now operational, and we have resumed money transfer services,\" says an email obtained by BleepingComputer. \"We recognize the importance of system security as we take these actions. We restored our systems only after taking extensive precautionary measures. At this time, we have no evidence that this issue involves ransomware nor do we have any reason to believe that this has impacted our agents' systems.\" A source familiar with the attack shared further information, telling BleepingComputer that MoneyGram was initially breached through a social engineering attack on the company's internal help desk. This attack allowed the threat actors to access MoneyGram's network using an employee's credentials and target employee information in the company's Windows Active Directory Services. However, they were detected and blocked before more damage could be done. BleepingComputer contacted MoneyGram with questions about the breach but did not receive a reply back. If you have any information regarding this incident or any other undisclosed attacks, you can contact us confidentially via Signal at 646-961-3731 or at tips@bleepingcomputer.com. While MoneyGram has not publicly attributed the attack to any particular threat actor, the strategies are reminiscent of attacks previously conducted by a loose-knit hacker collective known as Scattered Spider (aka UNC3944, the Com, and 0ktapus). In September 2023, Scattered Spider was behind a cyberattack on MGM Resorts, which they breached by impersonating an MGM employee while calling the IT help desk to reset the password. Once they gained access to the network, the threat actors deployed the BlackCat ransomware to encrypt hundreds of VMware ESXi servers. Due to the sophistication of their social engineering attacks, Microsoft, the FBI/CISA, and Mandiant released advisories on their tactics and how to defend against them.

        "text": "The APT33 Iranian hacking group has used new Tickler malware to backdoor the networks of organizations in the government, defense, satellite, oil and gas sectors in the United States and the United Arab Emirates. As Microsoft security researchers observed, the threat group (also tracked as Peach Sandstorm and Refined Kitten), which operates on behalf of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), used this new malware as part of an intelligence collection campaign between April and July 2024. Throughout these attacks, the threat actors leveraged Microsoft Azure infrastructure for command-and-control (C2), using fraudulent, attacker-controlled Azure subscriptions that the company has since disrupted. APT33 breached targeted organizations in the defense, space, education, and government sectors following successful password spray attacks between April and May 2024. In these attacks, they attempted to gain access to many accounts using a small number of commonly used passwords to avoid triggering account lockouts. \"While the password spray activity appeared consistently across sectors, Microsoft observed Peach Sandstorm exclusively leveraging compromised user accounts in the education sector to procure operational infrastructure. In these cases, the threat actor accessed existing Azure subscriptions or created one using the compromised account to host their infrastructure,\" Microsoft said. The Azure infrastructure they gained control of was used in subsequent operations targeting the government, defense, and space sectors. \"In the past year, Peach Sandstorm has successfully compromised several organizations, primarily in the aforementioned sectors, using bespoke tooling,\" Microsoft added. The Iranian threat group also used this tactic in November 2023 to compromise the networks of defense contractors worldwide and deploy FalseFont backdoor malware. In September, Microsoft warned of another APT33 campaign that had targeted thousands of organizations worldwide in extensive password spray attacks since February 2023, leading to breaches in the defense, satellite, and pharmaceutical sectors. Microsoft has announced that starting October 15, multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be mandatory for all Azure sign-in attempts to protect Azure accounts against phishing and hijacking attempts. The company has previously found that MFA allows 99.99% of MFA-enabled accounts to resist hacking attempts and reduces the risk of compromise by 98.56%, even when attackers attempt to breach accounts using previously compromised credentials.

        "text": "A new malware campaign is spreading a previously undocumented backdoor named \"Voldemort\" to organizations worldwide, impersonating tax agencies from the U.S., Europe, and Asia. As per a Proofpoint report, the campaign started on August 5, 2024, and has disseminated over 20,000 emails to over 70 targeted organizations, reaching 6,000 in a single day at the peak of its activity. Over half of all targeted organizations are in the insurance, aerospace, transportation, and education sectors. The threat actor behind this campaign is unknown, but Proofpoint believes the most likely objective is to conduct cyber espionage. The attack is similar to what Proofpoint described at the start of the month but involved a different malware set in the final stage. A new Proofpoint report says the attackers are crafting phishing emails to match a targeted organization's location based on public information. The phishing emails impersonate taxing authorities from the organization's country, stating that there is updated tax information and includes links to associated documents. Clicking on the link brings recipients to a landing page hosted on InfinityFree, which uses Google AMP Cache URLs to redirect the victim to a page with a \"Click to view document\" button. When the button is clicked, the page will check the browser's User Agent, and if it's for Windows, redirect the target to a search-ms URI (Windows Search Protocol) that points to a TryCloudflare-tunneled URI. Non-Windows users are redirected to an empty Google Drive URL that serves no malicious content. If the victim interacts with the search-ms file, Windows Explorer is triggered to display a LNK or ZIP file disguised as a PDF. The use of the search-ms: URI has become popular lately with phishing campaigns as even though this file is hosted on an external WebDAV/SMB share, it is made to appear as if it resides locally in the Downloads folder to trick the victim into opening it. Doing so executes a Python script from another WebDAV share without downloading it on the host, which performs system info collection to profile the victim. At the same time, a decoy PDF is displayed to obscure the malicious activity. The script also downloads a legitimate Cisco WebEx executable (CiscoCollabHost.exe) and a malicious DLL (CiscoSparkLauncher.dll) to load Voldemort using DLL side-loading. Voldemort is a C-based backdoor that supports a wide range of commands and file management actions, including exfiltration, introducing new payloads into the system, and file deletion. The list of supported commands is given below: A notable feature of Voldemort is that it uses Google Sheets as a command and control server (C2), pinging it to get new commands to execute on the infected device and as a repository for stolen data. Each infected machine writes its data to specific cells within the Google Sheet, which can be designated by unique identifiers like UUIDs, ensuring isolation and clearer management of the breached systems. Voldemort uses Google's API with an embedded client ID, secret, and refresh token to interact with Google Sheets, which are stored in its encrypted configuration. This approach provides the malware with a reliable and highly available C2 channel, and also reduces the likelihood of network communication being flagged by security tools. As Google Sheets is commonly used in the enterprise, it also makes blocking the service impractical. In 2023, the Chinese APT41 hacking group was previously seen using Google Sheets as a command and control server through the use of the red-teaming GC2 toolkit. To defend against this campaign, Proofpoint recommends limiting access to external file-sharing services to trusted servers, blocking connections to TryCloudflare if not actively needed, and monitoring for suspicious PowerShell execution.

        "text": "North Korean hackers have exploited a recently patched Google Chrome zero-day (CVE-2024-7971) to deploy the FudModule rootkit after gaining SYSTEM privileges using a Windows Kernel exploit. \"We assess with high confidence that the observed exploitation of CVE-2024-7971 can be attributed to a North Korean threat actor targeting the cryptocurrency sector for financial gain,\" Microsoft said on Friday, attributing the attacks to Citrine Sleet (previously tracked as DEV-0139). Other cybersecurity vendors track this North Korean threat group as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, and UNC4736, while the U.S. government collectively refers to malicious actors sponsored by the North Korean government as Hidden Cobra. Citrine Sleet targets financial institutions, focusing on cryptocurrency organizations and associated individuals, and has been previously linked to Bureau 121 of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. The North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites camouflaged as legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect potential victims with fake job applications or weaponized cryptocurrency wallets or trading apps. UNC4736 trojanized the Electron-based desktop client of video conferencing software maker 3CX in March 2023, following a previous supply-chain attack in which they breached the site of Trading Technologies, a stock trading automation company, to push trojanized X_TRADER software builds. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also linked AppleJeus to the compromise of Trading Technologies' website in a March 2022 report. The U.S. government also warned about North Korean-backed state hackers targeting cryptocurrency-related companies and individuals with AppleJeus malware for years. Google patched the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day last week, describing it as a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. This vulnerability enabled the threat actors to gain remote code execution in the sandboxed Chromium renderer process of targets redirected to an attacker-controlled website at voyagorclub[.]space. After escaping the sandbox, they used the compromised web browser to download a Windows sandbox escape exploit targeting the CVE-2024-38106 flaw in the Windows Kernel (fixed during this month's Patch Tuesday), which enabled them to gain SYSTEM privileges. The threat actors also downloaded and loaded the FudModule rootkit into memory, which was used for kernel tampering and direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) and allowed them to bypass kernel security mechanisms. Since its discovery in October 2022, this rootkit has also been used by Diamond Sleet, another North Korean hacking group with which Citrine Sleet shares other malicious tools and attack infrastructure. \"On August 13, Microsoft released a security update to address a zero-day vulnerability in the AFD.sys driver in Windows (CVE-2024-38193) identified by Gen Threat Labs,\" Microsoft said on Friday. \"In early June, Gen Threat Labs identified Diamond Sleet exploiting this vulnerability in an attack employing the FudModule rootkit, which establishes full standard user-to-kernel access, advancing from the previously seen admin-to-kernel access.\" Redmond added that one of the organizations targeted in attacks exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 Chrome zero-day was also previously targeted by another North Korean threat group tracked as BlueNoroff (or Sapphire Sleet). Russian APT29 hackers use iOS, Chrome exploits created by spyware vendors Google tags a tenth Chrome zero-day as exploited this year Google fixes ninth Chrome zero-day tagged as exploited this year South Korean hackers exploited WPS Office zero-day to deploy malware Google increases Chrome bug bounty rewards up to $250,000",

        "text": "Canadian video game developer Red Barrels is warning that the development of its Outlast games will likely be delayed after the company suffered a cyberattack impacting its internal IT systems and data. Although the statement emphasizes that the attack has not affected player data, the production timeline has been impacted. \"The Red Barrels team regrets to announce that its internal IT systems were recently impacted by a cybersecurity event, involving access to some of its data,\" reads a statement on Red Barrel's website. \"As soon as the event was detected, measures were deployed to secure the systems and the information contained therein. A group of leading external cybersecurity experts has been mandated to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident.\" \"We also notified stakeholders potentially affected by the event and the relevant authorities. As a precautionary measure our employees have been offered appropriate support.\" Red Barrels is a gaming studio founded in 2011 by industry veterans who have previously worked on successful titles such as Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell. The studio is best known for creating the Outlast series, a popular survival horror franchise with its third and latest installment, The Outlast Trials, released in March 2024. This title is specifically mentioned in the Red Barrels announcement, presumably to prepare players for delays in the delivery of patches, updates, and new content. The team previously teased Outlast 3, indicating they were already developing the next installment. While no release date has been confirmed, recent events will naturally affect the production timeline. \"The hit on our production timeline has been significant. We will do our best to follow our roadmap, but unfortunately, some things will have to be delayed,\" continued Red Barrel's statement. The gaming studio says its investigation into the incident has been completed, and the breach has been contained, promising to continue implementing security measures that will protect its players' and internal data. It is unclear if the hackers who performed the attack stole game source code or other assets related to upcoming projects that could damage the studio if leaked publicly. BleepingComputer contacted Red Barrels to request more information about the attack and its impact, and we will update this story as soon as we know more.

        "text": "Adobe Commerce and Magento online stores are being targeted in \"CosmicSting\" attacks at an alarming rate, with threat actors hacking approximately 5% of all stores. The CosmicSting vulnerability (CVE-2024-34102) is a critical severity information disclosure flaw; when chained with CVE-2024-2961, a security issue in glibc's iconv function, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the target server. The critical flaw impacts the following products: Website security company Sansec has been tracking the attacks since June 2024 and observed 4,275 stores breached in CosmicSting attacks, high-profile victims including Whirlpool, Ray-Ban, National Geographic, Segway, and Cisco, which BleepingComputer reported last month. Sansec says that multiple threat actors are now conducting attacks as patching speed is not matching the critical nature of the situation. \"Sansec projects that more stores will get hacked in the coming months, as 75% of the Adobe Commerce & Magento install base hadn't patched when the automated scanning for secret encryption keys started,\" warns Sansec. As Sansec had predicted, when CosmicSting was disclosed with little technical details and an urgent notice to apply the security updates, it announced one of the worst threats to the e-commerce ecosystem. The researchers are now tracking seven different threat groups that employ CosmicSting to compromise unpatched sites, named \"Bobry,\" \"Polyovki,\" \"Surki,\" \"Burunduki,\" \"Ondatry,\" \"Khomyaki,\" and \"Belki.\" These groups are considered financially motivated opportunists, breaching the sites to steal credit card and customer information. Ondatry was using the \"TrojanOrder\" flaw in 2022 but has now moved to CosmicSting, which goes to show how some threat actors specialize in the space and continually look for opportunities in easily exploitable critical vulnerabilities. The threat actors are leveraging CosmicSting to steal Magento cryptographic keys, inject payment skimmers to steal cards from order checkout webpages, and even fight each other for control over vulnerable stores. The malicious scripts are injected into compromised sites from domains that are named to appear as well-known JavaScript libraries or analytics packages. For example, the Burunduki hackers utilize the domain 'jgueurystatic[.]xyz' to appear to be jQuery. The Polyovki threat actors use 'cdnstatics[.]net' to appear as if the scripts are for website analytics, as shown in the compromise of Ray-Ban's online store. ​ BleepingComputer deobfuscated the lib.js script, and you can see below that the script attempts to steal customers' credit card numbers, names, expiration dates, security codes, and customer information. Sansec told BleepingComputer that it has warned many of the sites, including Ray-Ban, Whirlpool, National Geographic, and Segway, about these attacks multiple times but has not heard back from any of them. BleepingComputer has also emailed the impacted brands yesterday, but we have yet to receive a response. Sansec founder Willem de Groot says that Segway and Whirlpool appear to be fixed and BleepingComputer could not find the malicious code on Ray-Ban's site, indicating it may be fixed as well. Website administrators are strongly advised to move to the following versions (or later) as soon as possible: More details are available on Adobe's advisory. Sansec has provided a tool to check if their site is vulnerable and an \"emergency hotfix\" has been released to block most CosmicSting attacks, with both available here.

        "text": "Law enforcement authorities from 12 countries arrested four suspects linked to the LockBit ransomware gang, including a developer, a bulletproof hosting service administrator, and two people connected to LockBit activity. This joint action also led to seizures of LockBit infrastructure servers and involved police officers in Operation Cronos, a task force led by the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) behind a global LockBit crackdown and an investigation that began in April 2022. According to Europol, a suspected LockBit ransomware developer was arrested in August 2024 at the request of French authorities while on holiday outside of Russia. The same month, the U.K.'s National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested two more individuals linked to LockBit activity: one believed to be associated with a LockBit affiliate, while the second was apprehended on suspicion of money laundering. In a separate action, at Madrid airport, Spain's Guardia Civil arrested the administrator of a bulletproof hosting service used to shield LockBit's infrastructure. Today, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States also revealed sanctions against an individual the UK NCA believes is a prolific LockBit ransomware affiliate linked to Evil Corp. The United Kingdom sanctioned 15 more Russian nationals involved in Evil Corp's criminal activities, while the United States sanctioned six individuals and Australia targeted two. \"These actions follow the massive disruption of LockBit infrastructure in February 2024, as well as the large series of sanctions and operational actions that took place against LockBit administrators in May and subsequent months,\" Europol said. LockBit emerged in September 2019 and has since claimed responsibility for and been linked to attacks against many high-profile companies and organizations worldwide, including Bank of America, Boeing, the Continental automotive giant, the Italian Internal Revenue Service, and the UK Royal Mail. In February 2024, Operation Cronos shut down LockBit's infrastructure and seized 34 servers containing over 2,500 decryption keys that were later used to create a free LockBit 3.0 Black Ransomware decryptor. The U.S. Department of Justice and the UK NCA estimate that the gang has extorted up to $1 billion following at least 7,000 attacks between June 2022 and February 2024. Previous charges and arrests of cybercriminals linked to the Lockbit ransomware gang include Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev (aka Wazawaka) in May 2023, Artur Sungatov and Ivan Gennadievich Kondratiev (aka Bassterlord) in February 2024, and Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev (aka LockBitSupp and putinkrab) in May 2024. In July, Russian nationals Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov and Canadian/Russian national Mikhail Vasiliev also admitted to participating in at least a dozen ransomware attacks as affiliates of the LockBit ransomware-as-a-service operation. Astamirov was arrested in Arizona in June 2023 and charged with deploying LockBit ransomware. Vasiliev, who was extradited to the United States in June, has already been sentenced to four years in federal prison.

        "text": "The malicious PoorTry kernel-mode Windows driver used by multiple ransomware gangs to turn off Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions has evolved into an EDR wiper, deleting files crucial for the operation of security solutions and making restoration harder. Though Trend Micro had warned about this functionality added on Poortry since May 2023, Sophos has now confirmed seeing the EDR wiping attacks in the wild. This evolution of PoorTry from an EDR deactivator to an EDR wiper represents a very aggressive shift in tactics by ransomware actors, who now prioritize a more disruptive setup phase to ensure better outcomes in the encryption stage. PoorTry, also known as 'BurntCigar,' was developed in 2021 as a kernel-mode driver to disable EDR and other security software. The kit, used by several ransomware gangs, including BlackCat, Cuba, and LockBit, first gained attention when its developers found ways to get their malicious drivers signed through Microsoft's attestation signing process. Other cybercrime groups, such as Scattered Spider, were also seen utilizing the tool in breaches focused on credential theft and SIM-swapping attacks. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Poortry continued to evolve, optimizing its code and using obfuscation tools like VMProtect, Themida, and ASMGuard to pack the driver and its loader (Stonestop) for evasion. The latest report by Sophos is based on a RansomHub attack in July 2024 that employed Poortry to delete critical executable files (EXEs), dynamic link libraries (DLLs), and other essential components of security software. This ensures that EDR software cannot be recovered or restarted by defenders, leaving the system completely unprotected in the following encryption phase of the attack. The process starts with the user-mode component of PoorTry, identifying the security software's installation directories and the critical files within those directories. It then sends requests to the kernel-mode component to systematically terminate security-related processes and then delete their crucial files. Paths to those files are hardcoded onto PoorTry, while the user-mode component supports deletion either by file name or type, giving it some operational flexibility to cover a broader range of EDR products. The malware can be fine-tuned only to delete files crucial to the EDR's operation, avoiding unnecessary noise in the risky first phases of the attack. Sophos also notes that the latest Poortry variants employ signature timestamp manipulation to bypass security checks on Windows and use the metadata from other software like Internet Download Manager by Tonec Inc. The attackers were seen employing a tactic known as \"certificate roullete,\" where they deploy multiple variants of the same payload signed with different certificates to increase their chances that at least one will execute successfully. Despite efforts to track PoorTry's evolution and stop its effectiveness, the developers of the tool have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new defense measures. The EDR wiping functionality gives the tool an edge over defenders responding to attacks but could also provide new opportunities for detecting the attacks in the pre-encryption phase.

ScienceLogic confirmed to BleepingComputer that they quickly developed a patch to address the risk and distributed it to all impacted customers while still providing assistance where needed. \"We identified a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability within a non-ScienceLogic third-party utility that is delivered with the SL1 package,\" explained a statement from Jessica Lindberg, Vice President at ScienceLogic. \"Upon identification, we rapidly developed a patch to remediate the incident and have made it available to all customers globally.\" ScienceLogic declined to name the third-party utility to avoid providing hints to other hackers, as it might be used on several other products. The attack was first disclosed by a user on X who warned that a Rackspace outage from September 24 was due to active exploitation in the hosting provider's ScienceLogic EM7. \"Oopsie, a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability was exploited ... third-party ScienceLogic application used by Rackspace,\" an account named ynezz shared on X. \"We have confirmed that the exploit of this third-party application resulted in access to three internal Rackspace monitoring webservers.\" ScienceLogic SL1 (formerly EM7) is an IT operations platform for monitoring, analyzing, and automating an organization's infrastructure, including cloud, networks, and applications. It provides real-time visibility, event correlation, and automated workflows to help manage and optimize IT environments efficiently. Rackspace, a managed cloud computing (hosting, storage, IT support) company, uses ScienceLogic SL1 to monitor its IT infrastructure and services. In response to the discovery of the malicious activity, Rackspace disabled monitoring graphs on its MyRack portal until they could push an update to remediate the risk. However, the situation was worse than what a short Rackspace service status update reflected. As first reported by The Register, Rackspace's SL1 solution was hacked via the zero-day and some customer information was stolen. In an email sent to customers and seen by The Register, Rackspace warned that the hackers exploited the zero-day to gain access to web servers and steal limited customer monitoring data, including customer account names and numbers, customer usernames, Rackspace internally generated device IDs, device name and information, IP addresses, and AES256 encrypted Rackspace internal device agent credentials. Rackspace rotated those credentials as a precaution, despite them being strongly encrypted, and informed customers they needed to take no further action to protect from the malicious activity, which had been stopped. While the data is limited, it is common for companies to hide their devices' IP addresses behind content delivery systems and DDoS mitigation platforms. Threat actors could use the exposed IP addresses to target company's devices in DDoS attacks or further exploitation attempts. It is unknown how many customers have been impacted by this breach. Update 10/2 - A RackSpace spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following information: On September 24th, 2024, Rackspace discovered a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in a non-Rackspace utility that is packaged and delivered by the third-party ScienceLogic application (known as SL1).  This was not a Rackspace vulnerability. Rackspace utilizes the ScienceLogic application internally to provide system monitoring of some (but not all) Rackspace services. The system improperly accessed, as a result of exploitation of the SL1 vulnerability, is a Rackspace system used for generating internal performance reporting and is internal to Rackspace. Our forensic investigation identified no access to customer configurations, or their hosted data. Rackspace immediately notified ScienceLogic of their vulnerability. Rackspace worked with ScienceLogic to ensure development of a patch to remediate their vulnerability, and ScienceLogic has now made it available to all of their customers globally. Limited performance monitoring information of low-security sensitivity was improperly accessed. Out of an abundance of caution, all impacted customers have been notified. No remediation steps are required from customers. Rackspace’s monitoring functionality is not dependent on the ScienceLogic dashboard, and our Rackspace customer performance monitoring was not impacted by this event.  There was no interruption to our monitoring and alerting services for our customers. The only service impact to customers was the inability to access their associated ScienceLogic monitoring dashboard, which is an optional service feature infrequently utilized by some customers. - Rackspace spokesperson Comcast and Truist Bank customers caught up in FBCS data breach Man pleads guilty to stealing $37 million in crypto from 571 victims Outlast game development delayed after Red Barrels cyberattack Dutch Police: ‘State actor’ likely behind recent data breach T-Mobile pays $31.5 million FCC settlement over 4 data breaches",

        "text": "Texas healthcare provider UMC Health System was forced to divert some patients to other locations after a ransomware attack impacted its operations. In an announcement published on its website late last week, UMC disclosed it is responding to an IT outage impacting its network. While facilities remain open, some emergency and non-emergency cases are being diverted. The cause of the IT outage, according to the healthcare organization, was a ransomware attack. As of publication, no major ransomware groups have assumed responsibility for the attack at UMC, so the attackers are unknown. UMC is a large healthcare provider operating 30 clinics across West Texas and Eastern New Mexico, which are visited by 400,000 patients annually. Being the only 'Level 1 Trauma Center' within 400 miles, the UMC Health System in Lubbock plays a critical role for patients in need of urgent surgical care. The hospital is making accommodations to lessen the impact of the ransomware attack. However, certain departments remain closed or can only provide services with significant delays, with radiology being one of those. Medical prescription lists are unavailable at the UMC clinics due to the IT system outage, so patients are advised to bring them with them when visiting. Medical records are available on the patient portal, but UMC says they cannot be printed now. Finally, establishing communication over the phone or online portal cannot be guaranteed at this point, so those in need of immediate assistance are advised to visit a clinic. Ransomware attacks are typically accompanied by data theft, and in this case, the sensitive medical information of hundreds of thousands could be impacted. UMC has not touched the subject in its latest status update and noted that the investigation into the security incident is still ongoing, and updates will be provided when more information becomes available.

        "text": "A recently disclosed vulnerability in the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) open-source printing system can be exploited by threat actors to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with a 600x amplification factor. As Akamai security researchers found, a CVE-2024-47176 security flaw in the cups-browsed daemon that can be chained with three other bugs to gain remote code execution on Unix-like systems via a single UDP packet can also be leveraged to amplify DDoS attacks. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker sends a specially crafted packet, tricking a CUPS server into treating a target as a printer to be added. Each packet sent to vulnerable CUPS servers prompts them to generate larger IPP/HTTP requests aimed at the targeted device. This impacts both the target and the CUPS server, consuming their bandwidth and CPU resources. To initiate such an attack, a malicious actor only needs to send a single packet to an exposed and vulnerable CUPS service exposed online. Akamai researchers estimate that around 58,000 servers, out of over 198,000 exposed devices, could be recruited for DDoS attacks. Furthermore, hundreds of vulnerable devices demonstrated an \"infinite loop\" of requests, with some CUPS servers repeatedly sending requests after receiving an initial probe and some servers entering an endless loop in response to specific HTTP/404 errors. Many of these vulnerable machines were running outdated versions of CUPS (going as far back as 2007), which are easy targets for cybercriminals who can exploit them to build botnets via the RCE chain or use them for DDoS amplification. \"In the worst-case scenario, we observed what appeared to be an endless stream of attempted connections and requests as a result of a single probe. These flows appear to have no end, and will continue until the daemon is killed or restarted,\" the Akamai researchers said. \"Many of these systems we observed in testing established thousands of requests, sending them to our testing infrastructure. In some cases, this behavior appeared to continue indefinitely.\" This DDoS amplification attack also requires minimal resources and little time to execute. Akamai warns that a threat actor could easily take control of every exposed CUPS service on the internet in seconds. Admins are advised to deploy CVE-2024-47176 patches or disable the cups-browsed service from running to block potential attacks to mitigate the risk of having their servers added to a botnet or used in DDoS attacks. \"DDoS continues to be a viable attack vector used to harass and disrupt victims across the internet, from major industries and governments to small content creators, online shops, and gamers,\" Akamai's researchers warned. \"Although the original analysis focused on the RCE, which could have a more severe outcome, DDoS amplification is also easily abused in this case.\" As Cloudflare revealed this week, its DDoS defense systems had to protect customers against a wave of hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks reaching 3.8 terabits per second (Tbps), the largest such attack ever recorded. Cloudflare blocks largest recorded DDoS attack peaking at 3.8Tbps CUPS flaws enable Linux remote code execution, but there’s a catch SonicWall warns of critical access control flaw in SonicOS",

        "text": "The City of Columbus, Ohio, has filed a lawsuit against security researcher David Leroy Ross, aka Connor Goodwolf, accusing him of illegally downloading and disseminating data stolen from the City's IT network and leaked by the Rhysida ransomware gang. Columbus, the capital and most populous (2,140,000) city in Ohio, suffered a ransomware attack on July 18, 2024, which caused various service outages and unavailability of email and IT connectivity between public agencies. At the end of July, the City's administration announced that no systems had been encrypted, but they were looking into the possibility that sensitive data might have been stolen in the attack. On the same day, Rhysida ransomware claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging they stole 6.5 TB of databases, including employee credentials, server dumps, city video camera feeds, and other sensitive information. On August 8, after failing to extort the City, the threat actors published 45% of stolen data comprising 260,000 files (3.1 TB), exposing much of what they previously claimed to be holding. According to the City's complaint, the exposed dataset includes two backup databases containing large amounts of data gathered by the local prosecutors and police force, dating back to at least 2015, containing, among other things, the personal information of undercover officers. On the day of the data leak on Rhysida's extortion portal on the dark web, Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther stated on local media that the disclosed information was neither valuable nor usable and that the attack had been successfully thwarted. A few hours later, Goodwolf disputed the Mayor's claim that no sensitive or valuable data was exposed by sharing information with the media about what the leaked dataset included. In response to this, on August 12, Mayor Ginther claimed that the exposed data was \"encrypted or corrupted,\" so the leak is unusable and should be of no concern to the public. However, Goodwolf disputed these claims, sharing samples of the data with the media to illustrate that it contained unencrypted personal data of people in Columbus. \"Among the details laid bare were names from domestic violence cases, and Social Security numbers for police officers and crime victims alike. The dump not only impacts city employees, but also revealed personal information for residents and visitors going back years,\" reported NBC4. The lawsuit submitted by Columbus alleges that Goodwolf's conduct of spreading stolen data was both negligent and illegal, resulting in great concern in the community. Moreover, the City alleges that the leaked data isn't accessible to anybody, as Goodwolf stated, as it was published on a platform of limited access, requiring knowledge to locate. \"Defendant's actions of downloading from the dark web and spreading this stolen, sensitive information at a local level has resulted in widespread concern throughout the Central Ohio region,\" reads the complaint. \"Only individuals willing to navigate and interact with the criminal element on the dark web, who also have the computer expertise and tools necessary to download data from the dark web, would be able to do so.\" The complaint notes that Goodwolf's sharing of law enforcement data and the alleged plans to create a website for people to see if their data was exposed interferes with police investigations. The City seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction against Goodwolf to prevent further dissemination of stolen data. Additionally, the City is seeking damages exceeding $25,000. A reported by NBC4, a Franklin County judge issued the temporary restraining order yesterday, barring Goodwolf from accessing, downloading, and disseminating the City's stolen data. The order also requires the defendant to preserve all data that was downloaded to date. In a press conference about the lawsuit, shown below, City Attorney Zach Klein says that the lawsuit is not about suppressing free speech, as Goodwolf can still talk about the leak, but is aimed at preventing him from downloading and disseminating the stolen information.

        "text": "Security researchers have found a vulnerability in a key air transport security system that allowed unauthorized individuals to potentially bypass airport security screenings and gain access to aircraft cockpits. Researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered the vulnerability in FlyCASS, a third-party web-based service that some airlines use to manage the Known Crewmember (KCM) program and the Cockpit Access Security System (CASS). KCM is a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) initiative that allows pilots and flight attendants to skip security screening, and CASS enables authorized pilots to use jumpseats in cockpits when traveling. The KCM system, operated by ARINC (a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace), verifies airline employees' credentials through an online platform. The process involves scanning a KCM barcode or entering an employee number, then cross-checking with the airline's database to grant access without requiring a security screening. Similarly, the CASS system verifies pilots for cockpit jumpseat access when they need to commute or travel. The researchers discovered that FlyCASS's login system was susceptible to SQL injection, a vulnerability that enables attackers to insert SQL statements for malicious database queries. By exploiting this flaw, they could log in as an administrator for a participating airline, Air Transport International, and manipulate employee data within the system. They added a fictitious employee, \"Test TestOnly,\" and granted this account access to KCM and CASS, which effectively allowed them to \"skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners.\" \"Anyone with basic knowledge of SQL injection could login to this site and add anyone they wanted to KCM and CASS, allowing themselves to both skip security screening and then access the cockpits of commercial airliners,\" Carroll said. ​Realizing the severity of the issue, the researchers immediately began a disclosure process, contacting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on April 23, 2024. The researchers decided not to contact the FlyCASS site directly as it appeared to be run by a single person and were afraid the disclosure would alarm them. The DHS responded, acknowledging the seriousness of the vulnerability, and confirmed that FlyCASS was disconnected from the KCM/CASS system on May 7, 2024, as a precautionary measure. Soon after, the vulnerability was fixed on FyCASS. However, efforts to further coordinate a safe disclosure of the vulnerability were met with resistance after the DHS stopped responding to their emails. The TSA press office also sent the researchers a statement denying the vulnerability's impact, claiming that the system's vetting process would prevent unauthorized access. After being informed by the researchers, the TSA also quietly removed information from its website that contradicted its statements. \"After we informed the TSA of this, they deleted the section of their website that mentions manually entering an employee ID, and did not respond to our correction. We have confirmed that the interface used by TSOs still allows manual input of employee IDs,\" Carroll said. Carroll also said that the flaw could have allowed for more extensive security breaches, such as altering existing KCM member profiles to bypass any vetting processes for new members. After the researchers' report was released, another researcher named Alesandro Ortiz discovered that FlyCASS appeared to have suffered a MedusaLocker ransomware attack in February 2024, with a Joe Sandbox analysis showing encrypted files and a ransom note. ​\"In April, TSA became aware of a report that a vulnerability in a third party's database containing airline crewmember information was discovered and that through testing of the vulnerability, an unverified name was added to a list of crewmembers in the database. No government data or systems were compromised and there are no transportation security impacts related to the activities,\" TSA press secretary R. Carter Langston told BleepingComputer. \"TSA does not solely rely on this database to verify the identity of crewmembers. TSA has procedures in place to verify the identity of crewmembers and only verified crewmembers are permitted access to the secure area in airports. TSA worked with stakeholders to mitigate against any ​identified cyber vulnerabilities.\" BleepingComputer also contacted the DHS earlier today, but a spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Following 148 raids, 96 individuals were arrested and charged with organizing and participating in a criminal organization, unlawful access to computer information, illegal payment processing, and illegal banking activities. \"According to investigators, in 2013, defendants, possessing knowledge in the field of banking, created a criminal community to commit crimes and personal enrichment,\" according to a press release issued by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation (ICR), the leading federal investigating authority in Russia. \"The accomplices carried out illegal activities in exchanging currencies and cryptocurrencies, delivering and accepting cash, and selling bank cards and personal accounts. The main clients of these services were cybercriminals and hackers who used them to legalize their criminal income.\" Ministry of Internal Affairs Irina Volk told Interfax that \"the defendants issued bank cards and provided access to transactions through a personal online account.\" Russian investigators found that in 2023 alone, the criminal network's services processed over 112 billion rubles (just over $1.1 billion), generating 3.7 billion rubles (around $38.7 million) in illicit income for those involved. According to ICR spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko, assets seized during this action include over 1.5 billion rubles, Robinson helicopters, luxury vehicles (including Bentley, Rolls Royce, Porsche, and Tesla Cybertruck cars), boats, and snowmobiles. As sources in Russian Law enforcement agencies told Interfax, one of the key suspects arrested in this week's action is Russian money launderer Sergey Ivanov (also known by his 'Taleon' online handle), who was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) last week. The Treasury Department believes that Ivanov's UAPS, PinPays, and PM2BTC services helped process hundreds of millions of dollars for ransomware actors, darknet marketplace vendors, initial access brokers, and other threat actors over the last two decades. Ivanov and his associate Timur Shakhmametov (aka JokerStash and Vega) were also charged by the Justice Department with money laundering, bank fraud, and running multiple websites that sell stolen credit card information and personal data. According to the U.S. DOJ, Shakhmametov was a Joker's Stash operator, one of the largest online carding markets that made profits of up to $1 billion between 2014 and 2021, when it was shut down. The U.S. Department of State now also offers a reward of up to $11 million through its Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program for information that could help arrest or convict Ivanov and Timur Shakhmametov. Last week, Dutch authorities seized PM2BTC and Cryptex servers and over $7 million in cryptocurrency, while German law enforcement seized 47 cryptocurrency exchange platforms used to launder money for cybercriminals, including ransomware gangs.

        "text": "The Russian state-sponsored APT29 hacking group has been observed using the same iOS and Android exploits created by commercial spyware vendors in a series of cyberattacks between November 2023 and July 2024. The activity was discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), who said the n-day flaws have already been patched but remain effective on devices that have not been updated. APT29, also known as \"Midnight Blizzard\", targeted multiple websites of the Mongolian government and employed \"watering hole\" tactics. A watering hole is a cyberattack where a legitimate site is compromised with malicious code designed to deliver payloads to visitors that meet specific criteria, like device architecture or location (IP-based). Interestingly, TAG notes that APT29 used exploits that were almost identical to those used by commercial surveillance-ware vendors like NSO Group and Intellexa, who created and leveraged the flaws as zero days when no fix was available. Google's threat analysts note that APT29 has a long history of exploiting zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities. In 2021, the Russian cyber-operatives exploited CVE-2021-1879 as a zero-day, targeting government officials in Eastern Europe, attempting to deliver a cookie-stealing framework that snatched LinkedIn, Gmail, and Facebook accounts. In November 2023, APT29 compromised Mongolian government sites 'mfa.gov[.]mn' and 'cabinet.gov[.]mn' to add a malicious iframe that delivered an exploit for CVE-2023-41993. This is an iOS WebKit flaw that APT29 leveraged for stealing browser cookies from iPhone users running iOS 16.6.1 and older. TAG reports that this exploit was exactly the same as the one Intellexa used in September 2023, leveraging CVE-2023-41993 as a zero-day vulnerability at the time. In February 2024, APT29 compromised another Mongolian government website, 'mga.gov[.]mn,' to inject a new iframe delivering the same exploit. On July 2024, APT leveraged exploits for CVE-2024-5274 and CVE-2024-4671, impacting Google Chrome, to attack Android users visiting 'mga.gov[.]mn'. The purpose was to steal cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data stored on the victims' Chrome browser. The exploit used for CVE-2024-5274 is a slightly modified version of that NSO Group used for zero-day exploitation in May 2024, while the exploit for CVE-2024-4671 featured many similarities to Intellexa's previous exploits. It is unknown how the APT29 hackers gained access to the exploits previously known only to NSO Group and Intellexa. However, independently creating their own exploits with the limited information seems unlikely. Possible explanations include APT29 hacking spyware vendors, recruiting or bribing rogue insiders working at those firms or maintaining a collaboration either directly or via an intermediary. Another possibility is their purchase from a vulnerability broker who previously sold them to surveillance companies as zero-days. No matter how these exploits reach sophisticated state-backed threat groups, the key issue is that they do. This makes it even more critical to promptly address zero-day vulnerabilities labeled as 'under limited scope exploitation' in advisories—far more urgent than mainstream users might realize. North Korean hackers exploit Chrome zero-day to deploy rootkit Google tags a tenth Chrome zero-day as exploited this year Hackers steal banking creds from iOS, Android users via PWA apps Google fixes ninth Chrome zero-day tagged as exploited this year Google fixes Android kernel zero-day exploited in targeted attacks",

        "text": "The South Korea-aligned cyberespionage group APT-C-60 has been leveraging a zero-day code execution vulnerability in the Windows version of WPS Office to install the SpyGlace backdoor on East Asian targets. WPS Office is a productivity suite developed by the Chinese firm Kingsoft that is popular in Asia. Reportedly, it has over 500 million active users worldwide. The zero-day flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-7262, has been leveraged in attacks in the wild since at least late February 2024, but impacts versions from 12.2.0.13110 (August 2023) to 12.1.0.16412 (March 2024). Kingsoft \"silently\" patched the problem in March this year without informing the customers that the flaw was actively exploited, prompting ESET, who discovered the campaign and vulnerability, to publish a detailed report today. In addition to CVE-2024-7262, ESET's investigation unveiled a second severe flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-7263, which Kingsoft patched in late May 2024 with version 12.2.0.17119. CVE-2024-7262 resides in how the software handles custom protocol handlers, specifically 'ksoqing://,' which allows the execution of external applications through specially crafted URLs within documents. Due to improper validation and sanitization of these URLs, the flaw allows attackers to craft malicious hyperlinks that lead to arbitrary code execution. APT-C-60 created spreadsheet documents (MHTML files) where they embedded malicious hyperlinks hidden under a decoy image to trick the victim into clicking them, triggering the exploit. The processed URL parameters include a base64-encoded command to execute a specific plugin (promecefpluginhost.exe) that attempts to load a malicious DLL (ksojscore.dll) containing the attacker's code. This DLL is APT-C-60's downloader component, designed for fetching the final payload (TaskControler.dll) from the attacker's server, a custom backdoor named 'SpyGlace.' SpyGlace is a backdoor previously analyzed by Threatbook when APT-C-60 used it in attacks on human resources and trade-related organizations. While investigating APT-C-60's attacks, ESET's researchers discovered CVE-2024-7263, a second arbitrary code execution flaw impacting WPS Office, which emerged as an incomplete patch of CVE-2024-7262. Specifically, Kingsoft's initial attempt to address the problem added validation on specific parameters. However, some, like the 'CefPluginPathU8,' were still not adequately secured, allowing attackers to point to paths of malicious DLLs through promecefpluginhost.exe again. ESET explains that this vulnerability can be exploited locally or through a network share, where the malicious DLL could be hosted. Despite this possibility, the researchers did not observe APT-C-60 or any other actors leveraging the flaw in the wild. However, given enough time, it's not unlikely they would have discovered the security gap left by Kingsoft's bad patch. Users of WPS Office are recommended to move to the latest release as soon as possible, or at least 12.2.0.17119, to address both code execution flaws. \"The exploit is cunning as it is deceptive enough to trick any user into clicking on a legitimate-looking spreadsheet while also being very effective and reliable,\" warns ESET in the report. \"The choice of the MHTML file format allowed the attackers to turn a code execution vulnerability into a remote one.\" Check this GitHub repository for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with the APT-C-60 activity.

        "text": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a $31.5 million settlement with T-Mobile over multiple data breaches that compromised the personal information of millions of U.S. consumers. This agreement resolves the FCC Enforcement Bureau investigations into several cybersecurity incidents and resulting data breaches that impacted T-Mobile's customers in 2021, 2022, and 2023 (an API incident and a sales application breach). As part of the settlement, the telecom carrier must invest $15.75 million in cybersecurity enhancements and pay the U.S. Treasury an additional $15.75 million civil penalty. The company has also committed to implementing more robust security measures, including adopting modern cybersecurity frameworks like zero-trust architecture and multi-factor authentication that resists phishing attacks. \"Today's mobile networks are top targets for cybercriminals. Consumers' data is too important and much too sensitive to receive anything less than the best cybersecurity protections,\" said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. \"We will continue to send a strong message to providers entrusted with this delicate information that they need to beef up their systems or there will be consequences.\" As part of the agreement, T-Mobile has committed to enhance privacy, data security, and cybersecurity practices by addressing foundational security flaws, improving cyber hygiene, and adopting robust modern architectures by: \"With companies like T-Mobile and other telecom service providers operating in a space where national security and consumer protection interests overlap, we are focused on ensuring critical technical changes are made to telecommunications networks to improve our national cybersecurity posture and help prevent future compromises of Americans' sensitive data,\" Loyaan A. Egal, Chief of FCC's Enforcement Bureau, added. The FCC's Privacy and Data Protection Task Force, established in 2023 by Chairwoman Rosenworcel, played a central role in the investigation and settlement, just as it did when the FCC reached similar settlements with AT&T in September 2024 ($13 million) and Verizon on behalf of its subsidiary TracFone Wireless in July 2024 ($16 million). The FCC has also fined the largest U.S. wireless carriers almost $200 million in April 2024 for sharing their customers' real-time location data without their consent. The April forfeiture orders finalized Notices of Apparent Liability (NAL) issued against AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon in February 2020 and slapped each of the four carriers with multi-million fines: $12 million for Sprintand $80 million for T-Mobile (the two carriers have merged since the investigation began), more than $57 million for AT&T, and an almost $47 million fine for Verizon. In February, the FCC also updated its data breach reporting rules to require telecom companies to report data breaches impacting their customers' personally identifiable information within 30 days.

        "text": "Nuclear waste processing facility Sellafield has been fined £332,500 ($440k) by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) for failing to adhere to cybersecurity standards and putting sensitive nuclear information at risk over four years, from 2019 to 2023. According to the ONR announcement, Sellafield failed to follow its own approved cybersecurity protocols by leaving multiple vulnerabilities in its IT systems unpatched, violating the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003. Although no exploitation has occurred, the weaknesses exposed the facility to risks such as ransomware, phishing, and potential data loss, which could disrupt high-hazard operations and delay decommissioning work. Sellafield is one of Europe's largest nuclear facilities, located in Cumbria, UK. It plays a significant role in managing and processing radioactive materials, handling more nuclear waste in one location than any other facility worldwide. The site is involved in retrieving nuclear waste, fuel, and sludge from legacy ponds and silos, storing radioactive materials such as plutonium and uranium, managing spent nuclear fuel rods, and remediating and decommissioning nuclear facilities. Sellafield is a critical unit for the UK's nuclear waste management system, so its IT systems security is vital to ensure safe operations. Last year, a series of investigations by The Guardian into Sellafield's cybersecurity brought attention to multiple severe issues, revealing that contractors had easy access to critical systems where they, among other things, could install USB drives. Additionally, well-known vulnerabilities within the facility abound, giving the site the nickname \"Voldemort\" by people working there. An audit from French security firm Atos revealed that roughly 75% of Sellafield's servers were vulnerable to attacks with potentially catastrophic consequences. The nuclear site's operators pleaded guilty in June 2024 to their failure to comply with standard IT security regulations, admitting their failure. ONR investigated these reports, and while it confirmed that Sellafield failed to abide by the cybersecurity standards that underpin the operation of such sites in the UK, it says it found no evidence that the vulnerabilities were leveraged in attacks. This contrasts previous reports by the press that Russian and Chinese hackers allegedly planted malware on the site, and that security breaches occurred as far back as 2015. \"An investigation by ONR [...] found that Sellafield Ltd failed to meet the standards, procedures and arrangements, set out in its own approved plan for cyber security and for protecting sensitive nuclear information,\" reads ONR's announcement. \"Significant shortfalls were present for a considerable length of time. It was found that Sellafield Ltd allowed this unsatisfactory performance to persist, meaning that its information technology systems were vulnerable to unauthorized access and loss of data.\" \"However, there is no evidence that any vulnerabilities at Sellafield Ltd have been exploited as a result of the identified failings.\" Inspections conducted by the ONR on Sellafield revealed that the scenario of a successful ransomware attack could derail normal operations at the nuclear site for up to 18 months. Sellafield has replaced key people in senior leadership and IT management over the past year to implement plans to remediate the cybersecurity risks as soon as possible. Good progress has been seen on that front, according to ONR.
